# Chapter 4. Storytelling and Narrative 讲故事与叙事

Stories are as old as communication itself. Since the first protohominids daubed their paintings on the rough walls of their caves, stories have been told. Stories and games have been intertwined to varying degrees for almost as long.

故事与交流本身一样古老。自从第一群原始人在粗糙的洞穴墙壁上涂鸦以来，人们就开始讲故事。故事和游戏在不同程度上交织在一起的时间几乎一样长。

Computer games generally have some sort of story attached to them as well. Sometimes it is a one-paragraph backstory. In other cases, it's a fully integrated story line—where the game is the story.

电脑游戏一般也会附带一些故事。有时只是一段背景故事。在其他情况下，它是一个完全整合的故事线————游戏就是故事。

In this chapter, we discuss some guidelines for constructing compelling stories and integrating them into game designs. To some extent, the importance of story integration is dependent on the type of game you are designing: Some games require more integration than others. For example, a simple game such as Space Invaders requires only a one-liner: "Aliens are invading Earth, and only you can stop them." Why? It doesn't matter. The player's imagination takes care of that. At the other end of the spectrum, adventure games such as Grim Fandango and Discworld Noir have a detailed and involving story line, as convoluted and structured as any novel. And, of course, we have the middle range—games in which story is important but is not the overriding gameplay feature. This concept is illustrated in Figure 4.1. As we progress across the story spectrum from left to right, the importance of the story increases. Examples of games such as this include Half-Life and Luigi's Mansion (shown in Figure 4.2).

在本章中，我们将讨论构建引人入胜的故事并将其融入游戏设计的一些指导原则。在某种程度上，故事整合的重要性取决于你所设计的游戏类型：有些游戏比其他游戏需要更多的整合。例如，像《太空侵略者》这样的简单游戏只需要一句话：“外星人正在入侵地球，只有你能阻止他们”。为什么？这并不重要。玩家的想象力可以解决这个问题。在另一端，冒险游戏如《冥界狂想曲》和《碟形世界：无尽黑夜》的故事情节详尽而跌宕起伏，其曲折性和结构性不亚于任何小说。当然，我们还有位于中间的游戏————在这些游戏中，故事很重要，但并不是压倒一切的游戏特征。图 4.1 举例说明了这一概念。当我们从左到右跨越故事范围时，故事的重要性就会增加。这样的游戏包括《半条命》和《路易吉洋楼》（如图 4.2 所示）。
