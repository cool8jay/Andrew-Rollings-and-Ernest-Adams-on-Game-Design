This chapter is an introduction to the tools and techniques that we will use in later chapters when discussing the balancing of specific game genres. Different genres require different modes of balance, but in many cases, the common thread that binds them is the same.

本章是对工具和技术的介绍，我们将在后面的章节中讨论特定游戏类型的平衡问题。不同类型的游戏需要不同的平衡模式，但在许多情况下，将它们联系在一起的共同点是相同的。

The methods discussed in this chapter provide a basis for us to examine the issue of balance in games:

本章讨论的方法为我们研究游戏平衡问题提供了基础：

* What exactly do we mean by balance?\
 我们所说的平衡到底是什么意思？
* How do we define balance?\
 我们如何定义平衡？
* How can we say that one game is well balanced where another is not?\
我们怎么确定一种游戏很平衡，而另一种游戏却不平衡呢？

These are not easy questions to answer; an answer that may be correct for one person may be completely incorrect for another. In some ways, there can be no definitive answers to the questions. Like so many other questions in game design, the answer contains an unknown quantity: the player.

这些问题并不容易回答；对一个人来说可能正确的答案，对另一个人来说可能完全不正确。从某种程度上说，这些问题不可能有明确的答案。就像游戏设计中的许多其他问题一样，答案包含了一个未知数：玩家。

Although we can attempt to anticipate what sort of people will play our game, we will never be able to satisfy all of them. However, as fallacious as it may seem, we have to start somewhere. In balancing a game, we have to assume the existence of an average player and target the balance to suit that player. Remember, however, that your average player will not be anywhere near as skilled at computer games as you and your team. Don't fall for the extremely common mistake of "making a game that you enjoy playing." This statement has been the epithet for many promising games. The danger of aiming to make a game that you enjoy playing is that you run the risk of making a game that only you enjoy playing. A significant level of "dumbing down" may be required to make your game as accessible as possible to the average player. Do not be alarmed by this; you can cater for extremes by providing different difficulty settings, as necessary. So with this in mind, let's explore the subject of game balancing in more detail.

尽管我们可以尝试预测什么样的人会玩我们的游戏，但我们永远无法满足所有的人。然而，尽管看起来有些谬误，但我们总得有个起点。在平衡游戏时，我们必须假定存在一个普通玩家，并针对这个玩家来平衡游戏。但请记住，普通玩家的电脑游戏水平远不及你和你的团队。不要陷入“做自己喜欢玩的游戏”这一极其常见的错误。这句话是许多有前途游戏的代名词。以制作自己喜欢玩的游戏为目标的危险在于，你有可能制作出只有你自己喜欢玩的游戏。为了让普通玩家也能玩到你的游戏，你可能需要进行相当程度的“简化”。对此不要惊慌；你可以根据需要提供不同的难度设置，以满足极端情况的需要。有鉴于此，让我们来详细探讨一下游戏平衡的问题。
