Any game designer should agree that gameplay is the core of the game. Given an ideal world, designers would probably claim that gameplay should be put above all other considerations. And in a lot of cases, were it not for external pressures, these same game designers would attempt to treat the gameplay with the level of importance that it deserves. There's just one problem with this: There is no universally accepted definition of gameplay. Gameplay is an important, if nebulous, concept. Many times during discussions of games, we have heard comments such as, "This has great gameplay," followed by a detailed description of the particular aspect of the game. However, if instead you were to ask the question, "What is gameplay?", most answers would attempt to explain by example. Indeed, explanation by example can be helpful, but it requires that you infer a definition of gameplay by induction. Describing gameplay without using self-reference is similar to trying to explain the concept of red without reference to color. It is difficult to conceive, but not impossible.

任何游戏设计师都应该同意，游戏性是游戏的核心。在一个理想的世界里，设计师们可能会声称游戏性应高于其他所有考虑因素。而且在很多情况下，如果不是迫于外部压力，这些游戏设计师也会努力把游戏性放在应有的重要位置。但这有一个问题：游戏性并没有一个公认的定义。游戏性是一个重要的概念，尽管它很模糊。在讨论游戏的过程中，我们经常会听到这样的评论：“这款游戏的游戏性很强”，然后是对游戏特定方面的详细描述。然而，如果反过来问“什么是游戏性？”，大多数答案都会试图通过举例来解释。的确，举例说明可能会有所帮助，但这需要你通过归纳来推断游戏性的定义。在不使用自我参照的情况下描述游戏性，就好比在不参照颜色的情况下试图解释“红色”的概念。这很难想象，但并非不可能。

There is a reason for this difficulty: The concept of gameplay is extremely difficult to define. Each designer has his or her own personal definition of gameplay, formed from exposure to many examples over the course of a career.

这种困难是有原因的：游戏性的概念极难界定。每个设计师都有自己对游戏性的个人定义，这些定义是在其职业生涯中接触到许多实例后形成的。

Gameplay is so difficult to define because there is no single entity that we can point to and say, "There! That's the gameplay." Gameplay is the result of a large number of contributing elements. The presence, or lack thereof, of gameplay can be deduced by examining a particular game for indications and contraindications of these elements. (These terms are borrowed from medical terminology: An indication is a positive sign that implies the existence of gameplay, and a contraindication is a negative sign that implies that gameplay does not exist.)

游戏性之所以难以定义，是因为没有一个实体可以让我们指着它说：“看！这就是游戏性”。游戏性是大量元素共同作用的结果。游戏性的存在与否，可以通过研究特定游戏中这些元素的指征和禁忌症来推断。(这些术语借用自医学术语：适应症是指暗示游戏性存在的积极信号，禁忌症是指暗示游戏性不存在的消极信号）。

# Use of Language 语言的使用

In other fields, such as engineering, architecture, and mathematics, the spread of ideas is facilitated by the use of a common language. Each engineer or mathematician knows how to express ideas—even brand-new ideas—in the given language of the craft.

在其他领域，如工程、建筑和数学，思想的传播得益于共同语言的使用。每个工程师或数学家都知道如何用自己的专业语言表达想法，甚至是全新的想法。

The vocabulary and mechanism for expressing ideas is already there, formalized and developed over many years of practical use and theoretical study. As game designers, we do not have that luxury. Although there has been talk of defining a universal frame of reference for game designers, no such lexicon has been attempted in earnest. Any attempts that have so far been made have not gained major acceptance, and there is no real coordinated effort or cooperation between alternate factions (to the best of our knowledge).

表达想法的词汇和机制已经存在，并在多年的实际应用和理论研究中得到了正规化和发展。而作为游戏设计师，我们却没有这样的条件。虽然有人说要为游戏设计师定义一个通用的参考框架，但还没有人真正尝试过这样的词汇。据我们所知，迄今为止所做的任何尝试都没有得到广泛的认可，而且在不同派别之间也没有真正的协调努力或合作。

This chapter attempts to define gameplay without reference to itself or reliance on examples of itself for definition. That doesn't mean that we won't give examples, but those examples will not serve as definitions. Instead, they will be used in their traditional role to illustrate the definitions previously laid out. This will give us the beginnings of our lexicon of game design. This might or might not become a standard, but it is at least a starting point that we can use to explain our ideas in this book.

本章试图定义游戏性，但不涉及游戏本身，也不依靠游戏本身的例子来定义游戏性。这并不意味着我们不会举例说明，但这些例子并不能作为定义。相反，它们将以其传统的角色来说明之前阐述的定义。这将为我们提供游戏设计词汇的雏形。这也许会成为标准，也许不会，但至少是一个起点，我们可以用它来解释我们在本书中的想法。

# Defining Gameplay 定义游戏性

Although we briefly discussed (and loosely defined) gameplay in [Chapter 2](chapter-2.md), "Game Concepts," we did so in terms of the player experience. To continue, we examine gameplay independent of the player experience. We examine the core concepts of gameplay, which are invariant with the player. To do this, we need to state a player-independent definition of gameplay. Sid Meier once defined gameplay as "a series of interesting choices." This is an excellent starting point and forms the basis of our definition of gameplay. We take this statement one step further with our formal definition of gameplay:

尽管我们在[第二章](chapter-2.md) “游戏概念”中简要讨论了游戏性（并对其进行了松散的定义），但我们是在玩家体验的基础上进行讨论的。下面，我们将继续探讨独立于玩家体验的游戏性。我们将研究游戏性的核心概念，这些概念是与玩家无关的。为此，我们需要对游戏性下一个与玩家无关的定义。席德·梅尔曾将游戏性定义为“一系列有趣的选择”。这是一个很好的出发点，也是我们定义游戏性的基础。我们在此基础上更进一步，提出了游戏性的正式定义：

> One or more causally linked series of challenges in a simulated environment.
> 模拟环境中一个或多个因果联系的系列挑战。

On the surface, this does not seem that far removed from Sid Meier's original definition (although it's not quite as good of a sound bite). However, our statement is more precise and rigorous. To be fair, it's unlikely that Mr. Meier expected his original definition to be used for anything more than the off-the-cuff comment it was probably intended to be—a statement designed to challenge and spur further thinking on the subject. If this was the case, it certainly had its intended effect and served as an excellent starting point for our definition.

从表面上看，这似乎与席德·梅尔最初的定义相去不远（虽然听起来不那么顺耳）。不过，我们的表述更加准确和严谨。平心而论，梅尔先生不太可能期望他最初的定义会被用于其他目的，而仅仅是随口一说——旨在挑战和激发对这一主题的进一步思考。如果是这样的话，那么它肯定达到了预期的效果，并为我们的定义提供了一个极好的起点。

In the original statement, the use of the word series implies a number of sequential events. Although these events follow one another chronologically, there is no implication that they can be linked. For example, lightning strikes tend to come in a rapid succession of bolts, but there is no evidence to suggest that the strike order is anything other than chance. Hence, we need to define specifically that our gameplay events are linked by causality. Note that we do not say anything about whether the multiple series are required to be interlinked. In most cases, they are—for example, the multiple plot threads in an adventure game—but this is not a specific requirement.

在原文中，“系列”一词的使用意味着一系列相继发生的事件。虽然这些事件在时间上是相继发生的，但并不意味着它们之间存在联系。例如，闪电往往会接二连三地快速劈下，但没有证据表明劈下的顺序是偶然的。因此，我们需要明确定义我们的游戏事件之间存在因果关系。请注意，我们并没有说明多个系列是否必须相互关联。在大多数情况下，它们是相互关联的，例如冒险游戏中的多条情节线索，但这并不是一个具体的要求。

The second half of the original definition uses the words "interesting choices." Although this is true, we feel that this is too broad of a definition. Choosing to visit the cinema, deciding what movie to watch, and thinking about whether to have caramel popcorn or salted popcorn is an example of a series of interesting choices, but it isn't an example of gameplay. So we replace this with "challenges in a simulated environment." The reason for the further restriction to a simulated environment should be self-evident: We stop playing when we quit the game.

原始定义的后半部分使用了“有趣的选择”一词。虽然这是事实，但我们认为这个定义过于宽泛。选择去电影院、决定看什么电影、考虑是吃焦糖爆米花还是咸爆米花就是一系列有趣选择的例子，但这并不是游戏性的例子。因此，我们用“模拟环境中的挑战”来取代它。进一步限制在模拟环境中的原因不言自明：当我们退出游戏时，我们就停止了游戏。

Why are we using challenges in place of choices? Again, we feel that the word choices is too broad to be particularly useful. For example, we can make a decision to attempt to shoot the attacking robot, to avoid it, or to quit the game and play something else. All three of these are available choices, but only the first two are gameplay decisions. Consequently, we have chosen to use the word challenges because it more accurately describes the type of event that the player is subjected to.

为什么用“挑战”代替“选择”？同样，我们认为“选择”这个词过于宽泛，并不实用。例如，我们可以决定射击攻击机器人、避开它或退出游戏玩别的。这三种选择都是可用的，但只有前两种是游戏决策。因此，我们选择使用“挑战”一词，因为它能更准确地描述玩家所面临的事件类型。

Another example of a choice that is not directly a part of the gameplay is the prevalence of user-defined "skins" in games such as the Quake series and Half-Life. The player can choose any appearance, but it is purely a cosmetic choice and normally has little effect on gameplay (except when unscrupulous players use this to their advantage, either by deliberately choosing a skin that camouflages them too well—for example, in the extreme case, a moving, shooting crate—or by forcing all the opposing players to take on skins that make them more visible, such as pure white).

另一个不直接影响游戏性的选择是用户自定义 “皮肤 ”在《雷神之锤》（Quake）系列和《半条命》（Half-Life）等游戏中的盛行。玩家可以选择任何外观，但这纯粹是一种外观上的选择，通常不会对游戏产生什么影响（除非不法玩家利用这一点为自己谋利，故意选择一种能很好地伪装自己的皮肤--例如，在极端的情况下，选择一个移动的、会射击的箱子--或者强迫所有敌对玩家穿上能让自己更显眼的皮肤，例如纯白色）。

Odysseus faced many challenges on his 20-year voyage to return home to his wife, Penelope, in Homer's Odyssey. Gordon Freeman (and, by proxy, the player) faces many challenges on his quest to escape from the Black Mesa Research Laboratory in Valve's Half-Life. Tetris players face challenges in their attempts to attain a higher score. Even Pac-Man faces challenges in his attempts to eat all the pellets in the maze while avoiding the evil ghosts bent on his destruction.

在荷马史诗《奥德赛》中，奥德修斯为了回到妻子珀涅罗珀身边，在长达 20 年的航行中面临着许多挑战。在 Valve 的《半条命》中，戈登·弗里曼（也就是玩家）在逃离黑梅萨研究实验室的过程中面临着许多挑战。《俄罗斯方块》的玩家在试图获得更高分的过程中也面临着挑战。就连《吃豆人》也面临着挑战，他既要吃掉迷宫中的所有颗粒，又要避开一心想要消灭他的恶鬼。

The use of challenges is not perfect, but it'll do. An alternative to the use of the word challenges that we discussed in the past was ordeals, but this was found to be arguably too restrictive. Ideally, we'd like to use a word that indicates a concept somewhere between the two.

使用“挑战”一词并不完美，但也可以。我们过去曾讨论过“磨难”这个词，但发现这个词的限制性太强。理想的情况是，我们希望使用一个表示介于两者之间的概念的词。

## Pure Challenges

Pure challenges are the archetypal form of gameplay challenges. They are not often found in the wild in this form, but they form the basis for most, if not all, actual gameplay challenges. We first discuss the possible forms that pure challenges can take, and then we discuss how these can be applied to real gameplay situations.

Challenges come in many shapes and forms. Even within a genre, a good game presents a range of challenge types. The narrower the genre definition is, the narrower the range is, but this is usually not a problem. Game players who buy within genres tend to know what to expect. In fact, unless it is particularly well done and appropriate, they generally reject new forms of challenge as inappropriate to the genre in question.

An example is the inclusion of a fast-action, reflex-based arcade sequence in a traditional adventure game such as Escape from Monkey Island (see Figure 7.1). Handled properly, this can enhance the gameplay, giving a welcome break from the usual action. Handled badly, it can break the player's suspension of disbelief and effectively ruin the game.
