# Chapter 3. Game Settings and Worlds 第三章：游戏场景与世界

A game world is an artificial universe, an imaginary place whose creation begins with the (usually unspoken) words “Let's pretend….” Every game, no matter how small, takes place in a world. Most games have a physical, or at least a visible, manifestation of this world: a set of cards, a board, or an image on a computer screen. Even tic-tac-toe, one of the simplest games imaginable, has a world—a little diagram governed by rules and a victory condition. The boundaries of the diagram are the boundaries of the world. Any marks that you make outside of them are not part of the game.

游戏世界是一个人造的宇宙，是一个想象中的地方，它的创造始于“让我们假装……”（通常是不经意的）一句话。每款游戏，无论多小，都发生在一个世界里。大多数游戏都有一个物理世界，或者至少是一个可见的世界：一套牌、一个棋盘，或者电脑屏幕上的一个图像。即使是井字棋这种可以想象到的最简单的游戏也有一个世界——一个由规则和胜利条件支配的小图。图的边界就是世界的边界。你在图外所做的任何标记都不是游戏的一部分。

The football field defines the physical boundaries of the football game's world. The football game's world is also bounded by time: It has a beginning and an end. When the clock runs out, the world ceases to exist; the game is over. The game can also be interrupted; during a timeout, the world freezes. It still exists in the minds of the players and the spectators—the game is still in progress—but no change can take place within the world until the timeout is over.

足球场定义了足球游戏世界的物理边界。足球游戏的世界也以时间为边界：它有开始和结束。当时间耗尽时，世界就不复存在，比赛也就结束了。比赛也会中断；在暂停期间，世界会冻结。它仍然存在于球员和观众的脑海中——比赛仍在进行，但在暂停结束之前，世界不会发生任何变化。

Not all game worlds have a visible component. The game Twenty Questions consists only of some basic rules and a victory condition, but it still has a world and the world has boundaries. If you're playing Twenty Questions and the questioner asks, “Wanna go surfing after work?,” most people would say that the question lies outside the game world. It doesn't count as one of the 20 allowed. A text adventure is another game defined by words; the world is created in the player's imagination when he reads the text on the screen. A few master chess players can play in their heads, with no board at all—another example of a game world with no physical component.

并非所有游戏世界都有可见的组成部分。游戏《二十个问题》只有一些基本规则和一个胜利条件，但它仍然有一个世界，而这个世界是有边界的。如果你在玩“二十个问题”游戏，提问者问：“下班后想去冲浪吗？”，大多数人会说这个问题不属于游戏世界。它不算是 20 个问题中的一个。文字冒险游戏是另一种由文字定义的游戏；当玩家阅读屏幕上的文字时，世界就在玩家的想象中产生了。一些国际象棋大师可以在脑中下棋，根本不需要棋盘——这也是游戏世界没有物理组成部分的另一个例子。

The setting of a game is its fictional component, that aspect of the game that is a fantasy. Tic-tac-toe has no setting, nor does Twenty Questions; when you play them, you're not pretending to be anywhere else or to do anything besides what you're doing. Chess has just a scrap of a setting; although the board and the moves are abstract, the pieces have names that suggest a medieval court with its king and queen, knights and bishops. Stratego has even more of a setting. The pieces in Stratego are numbered, and you could play the game completely abstractly—my number 5 takes your number 6, and so on—but Milton Bradley has chosen to paint little pictures on them, encouraging us to pretend that they are colonels and sergeants and scouts in an army.

游戏的背景是其虚构的组成部分，是游戏的幻想部分。井字棋没有背景，《二十个问题》也没有；当你玩这些游戏时，你并没有假装在其他任何地方，也没有做任何你正在做的事情以外的事情。国际象棋只有一点点背景；虽然棋盘和走法都很抽象，但棋子的名字却让人联想到中世纪宫廷里的国王和王后、骑士和主教。西洋陆军棋的背景则更加丰富。西洋陆军棋中的棋子是有编号的，你可以完全抽象地玩这个游戏——我的 5 号吃掉你的 6 号，以此类推——但米尔顿·布拉德利选择在棋子上画上小图画，鼓励我们假装它们是军队中的上校、军士和侦察兵。

# The Purpose of a Game Setting 游戏设置的目的

Games exist to entertain, and the entertainment value of a game is derived from several sources: its gameplay, its story, social interaction (if it is a multi-player game), and so on. The setting also contributes to the entertainment that the game provides. In a game such as chess, almost all the entertainment value is in the gameplay; few people think of it as a game about medieval warfare. In an adventure game such as Escape from Monkey Island, the setting is essential to the fantasy. Without the setting, Escape from Monkey Island would not exist, and if it had a different setting, it would be a different game.

游戏是为了娱乐而存在的，而游戏的娱乐价值来自多个方面：游戏玩法、故事情节、社交互动（如果是多人游戏）等等。游戏环境也有助于提高游戏的娱乐性。在国际象棋这样的游戏中，几乎所有的娱乐价值都体现在游戏性上；很少有人会认为这是一款关于中世纪战争的游戏。而在《逃离猴岛》这样的冒险游戏中，环境对于奇幻游戏来说至关重要。没有背景，《逃离猴岛》就不存在，而如果有不同的背景，它就会是另一款游戏。
