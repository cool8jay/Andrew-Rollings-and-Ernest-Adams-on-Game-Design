The designation "action game" covers a wide range of game styles, both 3D and 2D. But all games categorized under this label invariably have one aspect in common—they are all twitch games. The key skills tested by the gameplay are reaction time and hand-eye coordination under pressure. Action games tend to be simpler than most other types because there is only so much information and complexity that the average brain can interpret in unit time. As a general rule, this relationship can be stated as an inverse proportionality between the speed of a game and the complexity.

“动作游戏”这一名称涵盖了 3D 和 2D 两种游戏风格。但所有被归类到这一标签下的游戏都有一个共同点——它们都是反应类游戏。游戏考验的关键技能是压力下的反应时间和手眼协调能力。动作游戏往往比大多数其他类型的游戏简单，因为一般大脑在单位时间内所能解读的信息和复杂程度有限。一般来说，这种关系可以表述为游戏速度与复杂程度成反比。

Action games are the oldest genre—the very first arcade games were mainly action games, because the nature of the beast is exemplified in its simplicity. The game mechanics and gameplay are very simple and, provided the presentation layer is correspondingly simple, they are ideally suited to the lower spec (and older) machines.

动作游戏是最古老的游戏类型——最早的街机游戏主要是动作游戏，因为动作游戏的本质体现在其简单性上。游戏机制和玩法都非常简单，只要表现层也相应简单，它们就非常适合配置较低（和较老）的机器。

# Action Game Genres 动作游戏类型

For the purposes of discussion, the "action game" genre can be further divided into two sub-genres: those with shooting and those without. These sub-genres can be further divided, but at this point we would start to get into technology based distinctions—that is, the divisions are dependent on the technology used to present the game. For example, some people consider that the first-person shooter (FPS) is a genre in its own right. We can see this point of view, and it is a valid one under some circumstances. However, the key skill used in a FPS is reaction-based, and hence we'll be approaching all games that rely on reaction times as their key playing hook as a single genre. This is not as useless as it may seem. The fundamental patterns of action games—whether 2D, 3D, shooting, or non-shooting—are the same, no matter what the presentation layer.

为了便于讨论，“动作游戏”类型可进一步分为两个子类型：射击游戏和非射击游戏。这些子类型还可以进一步划分，但在这一点上，我们将开始进入基于技术的区分——也就是说，划分取决于用于呈现游戏的技术。例如，有些人认为第一人称射击游戏（FPS）本身就是一种类型。我们可以看到这种观点，而且在某些情况下也是合理的。然而，FPS 游戏中使用的关键技能是反应，因此我们将把所有以反应时间为主要玩法的游戏作为一个类型来看待。这并不像看起来那么无用。不管是 2D、3D、射击还是非射击，动作游戏的基本模式都是一样的，不管其表现层是什么。

So, given that we could argue that any distinctions within the action genre are pretty much arbitrary, we'll bravely soldier on with our basic division into shooters and non-shooters. Characteristically (and rather stereotypically) shooter games tend to appeal more to the male demographic, and non-shooters tend (although much more loosely) to appeal to female gamers more. (Consider that Pac-Man was one of the first wildly successful games to have a roughly equal male/female player split. However, it's clear that this is not the only factor—Centipede, a game that certainly involved violence, was also fairly successful with females.)

因此，我们可以说，动作类游戏中的任何区分都是非常武断的，我们将勇敢地继续把游戏分为射击类和非射击类。射击类游戏的特点是（相当刻板地）倾向于吸引男性玩家，而非射击类游戏则倾向于（尽管更宽泛地）吸引女性玩家。(考虑到《吃豆人》是第一批大获成功的游戏之一，其男女玩家比例大体相当）。不过，这显然不是唯一的因素--蜈蚣，一款当然涉及暴力的游戏，在女性玩家中也相当成功）。

Dividing the genre into shooters and non-shooters is useful, but it's still not quite fine-grained enough to be able to discuss the genre fully. The elements and rules can, for the most part, still be applied to just the two divisions, but there are certain issues that need to be covered in specific areas. Let's look at each of these divisions in a little more detail, and cover some of the types of game that are included in each of the divisions.

Almost all action games use a number of common elements that are covered in this chapter, such as lives, reaction tests, and hand-eye coordination tests. Many of them also use the levels, waves, and power-up design elements. Less common nowadays, but originally very common (possibly due to hardware limitations), is the single-screen element.

We will be discussing all of these elements later in the chapter. Before we do that, we will examine each of our initial genre divisions in turn, starting with the shooters.

## Shooters

Shooters make up the majority of action games. Shooter games (despite their designation) don't always involve explicit shooting, but they do focus on violence as a major game mechanic. Shooters generally—but not always—focus on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually, this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A smaller portion of these makes use of local effect weapons, as in the case of fighting games, ranging from games such as the Street Fighter series to the modern tour de force of Dead or Alive 3. Screens from both are shown in Figure 9.1.

Figure 9.1. Fighting games.

graphics/09fig01.jpg

Usually, this particular class of game presents a similar interface, showing both fighters onscreen at once. Even if a fighting game is portrayed in 3D, the main playing region is the vertical 2D plane defined by drawing a straight line between the two fighters. Thus, almost without exception, the "3D" fighting game is still played in a 2D sense, no matter how much eye candy is thrown your way. Of course, 3D isn't the main area of innovation in fighting games, although the added realism it can provide is certainly worthwhile. For the most part, the area of innovation in fighting games is in the realism of the characters, (including their interactions with each other and their reactions to injury), and the methods used to control the fighters—especially when considering how to handle special moves and combos. The main elements found within fighting games are variants of rock-paper-scissors (to handle the outcomes of playing certain moves against another) and the combo move.

Of course, the majority of games involving violence are actually "shooters." There are two broad classes that we will consider here: first-person shooters (FPS) such as Quake III, Unreal Tournament, and Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and 2D shooters such as R-Type, Space Tripper, Commando, Gauntlet Legends, Space Invaders, Robotron, Defender, Uridium, and Centipede. Even though this list of games seems to include many that are not similar to the others, they all share the common attributes of an avatar, one or more ranged weapons, and a varying number of enemies. Each of the games take place in an arena designed to require a strategic use of the weapon(s) and of any other tools that the player's avatar may be provided with. Figures 9.2 to 9.5 show a selection of these games.

Figure 9.2. Gauntlet and Gauntlet Legends.

graphics/09fig02.jpg

Figure 9.5. Uridium and Space Tripper.

graphics/09fig05.jpg

The reason that this particular range of 2D games has been chosen is that the gameplay has been enduring enough to have inspired modern updates. This implies that these games have some admirable qualities that we would do well to emulate. Of course, not all the updated versions have succeeded in capturing the gameplay of their parents as well as the designer might hope; in other cases, however, the gameplay matches or exceeds the original.

The original versions of the games were all completely 2D, because they were all written way before the hardware to support advanced 3D graphics had even been conceived of. With so little hardware power, the focus couldn't really be on the graphics or flashy effects, so all the focus went into the gameplay. Fortunately, the developers of the updated versions realized this, and for the most part, they succeeded in the difficult task of preserving the gameplay while updating the appearance to keep up with modern standards.

The original Gauntlet was one of the first games that provided the option for cooperative multi-play (see Figure 9.2). Each player could take on one of four avatars (Warrior, Wizard, Valkyrie, and Elf), and adventure through an (almost) endless series of dungeons, searching for treasure and food. This game introduced (more or less) many of the common action game elements we will be discussing later, such as the locked door and key, monster generators, team play, and dungeon exit.

There have been many updates for the classic Gauntlet, starting with the immediate sequel, Gauntlet II. Some have been more successful than others. The most recent of these updates, Gauntlet Legends, brings the graphics and environment up to date, adding a backstory and some extra features, but still manages to maintain the core of the old game mechanic.

Similarly, the original Robotron 2084 was a classic game when it was released into arcades back in 1982 (see Figure 9.3). The sole object of this game was to defend the last human family against wave upon wave of killing machines bent on their destruction. Another notable feature was the ability to shoot independently of the direction in which the avatar was moving. This was controlled by a second joystick.

Figure 9.3. Robotron 2084 and Robotron X.

graphics/09fig03.gif

The strength of the Robotron gameplay meant that for many years, updates just didn't happen. In fact, you can still get pixel-perfect versions of Robotron 2084 for the PC, Gameboy Advance, and other consoles. The first updated version (that we know of) was more of a tribute to the original Robotron than an update—Super Smash TV, based around a TV show where the contestants battled hordes of attackers in single-screen arenas.

The first "official" update of this game, Robotron X, heralded the start of the "retro-gaming" fad, and updated the graphics to 3D. The gameplay (apart from a few extra bonus levels) was barely touched, but the shift to 3D negatively impacted the playability.

The advantage of the original Robotron was that all the action could be viewed onscreen at one time (using the single-screen design element). The 3D update, with its swooping camera, often obscured parts of the playing area. This meant that occasionally you would be killed by an enemy that suddenly appeared from an off-camera region—an impossibility in the original game. This detracts from the playability because it is not the player's fault that he cannot see offscreen. In the original Robotron, if the player died, it was his fault—all the information was there to be interpreted, so he had no excuses if he failed to react to the situation quickly enough to avoid the danger.

Centipede is yet another classic arcade game from the early days (see Figure 9.4). This game is often lauded as an example of near-perfect gameplay. The elements of the game are set up in such a way as to balance out perfectly and exhibit many interesting emergent properties. The player has to make informed choices about when and how to clear the mushrooms—too many, and the centipede has an easier time reaching you and is harder to hit; too few, and more enemies appear to add more mushrooms.

Figure 9.4. Centipede and Centipede 3D.

graphics/09fig04.jpg

Hasbro, flushed with the success of their Frogger remake, which sold millions of copies, decided to try again with a new remake. The remake of Centipede added 3D graphics, and a story. Unfortunately, something was lost during the process, and the gameplay suffered as a consequence. Even the inclusion of a pseudo-3D version of the original arcade game failed to save this attempt at retro-chic. One of the keys behind the playability of the original Centipede (and, in fact, a consistent theme running through all successful action games) was that the player did not have to think in order to interpret what was on the screen. It was easy, and took place at a subconscious level: The centipede is one color, mushrooms are another color, and spiders are yet another color. Unfortunately, this use of color to provide information was lost in the update, where the emphasis was on the graphics appearing realistically textured and interesting. Unfortunately, that meant that the players' subconscious had to work that much harder to be able to determine what was happening onscreen. Combine this with the shift from a 2D fixed play-field to a fully scrolling 3D world, and it becomes fairly easy to understand why this update failed to maintain the standards set by the original.

As shown in Figure 9.5, the space shooter is one of the oldest styles of games. From the venerable Space Invaders through to modern masterpieces such as Space Tripper, this has been a class of game that is consistently popular. One of the fondly remembered classic games from the days of 8-bit computers is Uridium, a game that puts the player in a Manta assault craft on a one-man attack run against a fleet of enemy space stations. As the Manta flies from left to right, waves of aliens and missiles launched from the stations converge on the player. The space stations were huge, spanning several screen-widths, and so the player had to be aware of what was happening not only on the visible screen he could see, but also in the much larger region that he could not. This was a mechanic lifted straight from Williams' Defender, although Uridium is played from a top-down view, not a side view. This class of game requires extremely good reflexes on the part of the player, and additionally, the ability to form a mental model of what was happening outside the bounds of the screen. There are two main classes of scrolling shooter—those with fixed scrolling, where the screen would continuously scroll in one direction such as Irem's R-Type, and those with variable scrolling, where the player had some degree of control over the scroll direction.

Usually the degree of control was limited. Common configurations included horizontal, vertical, 4-way, 8-way, and multi-way scrolling. For players to be able to form the mental model required for successful play, a different technique is required for each of these types. The fixed scrolling games relied more often than not on memory. As well as reaction-time challenges, they also used memory challenges. A player learned the game as she played; if she got killed in a particular spot once, then she would learn the pattern of enemies for the next time around and hopefully wouldn't suffer the same fate. This was also used (although not to the same all-encompassing extent) in the variably scrolling games. In most cases, it certainly did the player no harm to remember the rough order of enemy attack, but the gameplay was not centered on that as a core mechanism. Instead, this class of game often provided players with a mini-map that displayed the game world in miniature, giving them an idea of what to expect to appear next on the edge of their screens. Space Tripper, from PomPom (www.pompom.org.uk), is a modern update of the archetypal scrolling shooter using 3D graphics and focuses on the core gameplay of the genre. Similar in concept to Uridium, it succeeds by using the 3D graphics solely as a presentation method. The actual game makes little use of the third dimension—except occasionally for dramatic effect—and remains, for the most part, a 2D game. This is what makes it so effective—the developers have not succumbed to the temptation to make 3D an important part of the gameplay. For this style of fast-action game, it's hard enough maneuvering in 2D—to do so in 3D would be an order of magnitude more difficult.

Figure 9.6 shows two examples of the logical extension of the 2D shooter—the 3D FPS. This is the ultimate expression of the shooter side of the genre. Fully 3D FPS games are an entirely different animal from their 2D ancestors. For a start, they are bound by hardware limitations to a much greater extent than 2D games. This can be clearly seen from the early 3D FPS games such as Battlezone, where there were no more than two or three enemies at one time. Even more recent games, such as Quake III, have comparatively few enemies present. Of course, this is not just due to hardware issues (which will become much less of an issue over the next few years). It's also due to perspective issues. The player can only interpret and handle so much information at one time, and shifting the perspective to full 3D complicates this. This will be explained in more detail in the later section on game perspectives.

Figure 9.6. Battlezone and Quake III.

## Non-Shooters

Many games—particularly in the early years of the industry before commercial pressures intervened to the levels they have today—were non-violent. This proliferation of non-violent games with strange themes is often likened to the early days of the movie industry, where creativity was the highest driving force, before the big money moved in.

Today, most games seem to be aimed at the typical male 25-35 demographic, but there are still notable exceptions. As we've already stated, the non-violent games seem to appeal more to the female demographic. One of the reasons for this, we feel, is that by removing the easy option of violence, the designer has to think a little bit harder about how to provide the gameplay hooks.

Notable "non-shooter" action games include Marble Madness, Lode Runner, Pac-Man, Chuckie Egg, the Mario games, Q*Bert, Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2, Pong, Donkey Kong, and Frogger. All these games have the same non-violence motif running through them (although the latter two are arguable). The primary reason for this is because the games were (to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the game) designed to be appealing to children, particularly in the case of the Mario series of games.

Frogger, shown in Figure 9.7, was originally a highly successful arcade game released back in 1981. The aim of the game was to get the world's only non-swimming frog family across a busy road and a logging river infested with crocodiles and fickle turtles. From these humble beginnings sprang one of the most successful series of remakes of all time. Hasbro's remake of Frogger (also shown in Figure 9.7) sold millions of copies, and was a mainstay of the software charts for many months after release. Interestingly enough, the developers focused on keeping the gameplay virtually unchanged, and just updated the presentation, increasing the variety of the levels available to the player. Frogger 2, released several years later, introduced a more structured game, while still remaining faithful to the core gameplay of the original.

Figure 9.7. Frogger and Frogger 3D.

graphics/09fig07.jpg

Of course, the phenomenal success of the Frogger remake caused a scramble for licenses for further remakes, which the publishers viewed as a license to print money. Consequently, there have been a number of ill-advised and hastily conceived remakes released onto the market. Pac-Man was one of the most successful games of its generation. Obviously, it could not escape being remade. One of the (many) remakes was Pac-Man: Adventures in Time. This update brought new additions to the game, including a story and a set of themed levels. Unfortunately, much in the same way as with Centipede, these additions diminished rather than added to the gameplay. However, Pac-Man World 2 on the Gamecube is an excellent use of the license.

Another phenomenally successful game was Q*Bert, initially released in 1982. This game placed a strange orange character on a pyramid of cubes, who was then chased by enemies including a cascade of balls and an evil snake named Coily. The object of the game was to change all the cubes to a target color by landing on them one or more times. The remake (shown on the right in Figure 9.8) followed the familiar pattern of adding a story and updating the presentation. Fortunately, due to the quasi-3D appearance of the original game, the gameplay translated well to the update, and the story doesn't affect the gameplay negatively, aside from minor issues caused by the entire playing area not being visible on the screen at one time.

# Design Elements

Action games are a good source of distinct design elements, mainly because their relative simplicity makes analysis of their game mechanics fairly easy compared to the more complex genres.

What we are attempting to do when we are extracting design elements from games on a genre-by-genre basis is to form the basis of a genre-describing "meta-game." What we mean by meta-game is a description of an archetypal action game. Of course, such a construct is purely hypothetical. It would be pretty much impossible to actually produce a fully comprehensive document. So with this in mind, let's start with an analysis of the design elements that govern the rules of the game. These design elements are only a small subset of the whole, but the aim is to give a starting point for your own investigations into the gameplay mechanics of action games.

## The Rules

The rules of an action game describe the basic game mechanics. They are usually very simple because of the frenetic nature of the gameplay. Fundamentally, action games are games that require skill as the primary factor for play, not rote memorization of complex rules.

There are many design elements that we can examine here, and the following few sections will cover some of these. Note that words in bold indicate references to other design elements within this chapter.

### Levels

Action games are often split into a succession of levels. A level is a specifically defined area in the game arena, in which the objective for the player is to complete a specific task. When the task is finished, the level is complete. Each level is played until complete, and upon completion the player's avatar is moved to the next level, and play continues. Generally, the difficulty will increase with each subsequent level.

Often, levels are grouped by theme. All the themed levels in the set will have a similar appearance and set of enemies. A set of themed levels usually ends with an encounter with a big boss. In some cases, the boss has to be defeated with the use of power-ups and/or skills that the player gained during the preceding level set.

### Checkpoints

If the nature of the game is such that the player progresses through a level, then the position that the player's avatar appears in after a life has been lost is often determined by the use of checkpoints.

The most straightforward form of checkpoint is that the avatar appears in the same location where it died, or in the case where that is impossible (for example, Mario falling into water), then it appears in the last safe location before it died (for example, the last platform that Mario was on before he fell in the water). The state of the level is unchanged—the avatar just reincarnates, and play continues.

Other (more difficult) games, such as Space Tripper, simply restart the level from the beginning upon avatar death. This particular form is fairly rare, because it increases the game challenge significantly, and often causes player frustration. It requires that the player play a "perfect" level in order to progress to the next one.

The final form of this design element is an amalgam between the first two. As the player progresses through the level, he reaches a number of predefined checkpoints. When the avatar dies, the level is reset to the last checkpoint that the player successfully achieved. An example of a classic game that uses this form is Moon Patrol, shown in Figure 9.9.

Figure 9.9. Moon Patrol.

graphics/09fig09.gif

### Lives

The player's avatar is usually given a small number of reprieves from death. Initially, the number of lives provided usually ranges from between three and five. A life is lost by collision with an enemy or some other dangerous structure. Extra lives can be earned either by picking up a power-up or reaching a certain score threshold multiple. The player's avatar is usually invulnerable for a few seconds when reappearing after losing a life, in order for the player to gather his bearings. When all lives are lost, the game is over.

Often, this design element appears in conjunction with the energy design element. If this occurs, then the avatar isn't destroyed immediately on contact with the enemy. Instead, energy is drained from the avatar. When all the energy is drained, a life is lost. When all lives are lost, the game is over.

### Energy

The player's avatar is given a limited amount of energy, some of which is depleted when the avatar is injured. It can often be partially, or even fully, replenished by the use of a collectible or a power-up. When the avatar's energy is depleted, the game is over.

This design element is sometimes used in conjunction with the lives design element. In this case, when the avatar's energy is depleted, one of the lives are lost. Sometimes the energy is spread over a number of physical features—for example, it can be a limited resource that is shuffled between shields and fuel, requiring the player to carefully balance resources.

### Time Limit

The time limit design element is indicated by the use of a timer that counts down from some initial value to zero. When the timer reaches zero, an action occurs that causes a major event in the game.

The time limit is normally used in one of three ways. The first way is as a level timer. The player has a limited amount of time to complete the level, and if he fails to do so, the level is reset, and the player has to start again. Often, this is accompanied by a life loss and, if the level is finished with time left over, then this excess time is multiplied by a constant as a score bonus.

The second use of the time limit design element is as the countdown to a catastrophe. The player has to achieve some task before the timer runs out, or the task will become much more difficult to achieve. This particular form is used in Sinistar. When the timer runs out, it means that the eponymous Sinistar has been built, and the player is in a lot of trouble.

The third use of the time limit design element is to limit the effectiveness of power-ups. When the timer runs out, the temporary power-up that it governed is removed, and the player's avatar reverts to the normal state. Pac-Man's power pellets, which allow the Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for a limited time, are good examples of this form.

### Score

One feature that is often specific to action games is the score indicator. Often in an action game, the only indicator of progress is a score. It is how the player is intended to measure her success against others. Many types of games do not use the score pattern, but action games are pretty much centered around it.

Scores are recorded in high-score tables for posterity, and to provide bragging rights for the very best players. Many games also reward skillful play with bonus scores and multipliers. The classic example of the score multiplier in action can be found in Pac-Man: After getting the power pill, the first ghost eaten earns 200 points, the next earns 400 points, then 800, and then 1600 respectively. Hence, skillful play is rewarded with higher and higher scores.

### Power-Ups

One of the staple design elements of action games is the power-up. As a reward for progress, the player is given the opportunity to increase the strength of his avatar. In the case of a shooter, this can come in the form of stronger weapons or shields.

Power-ups come in two main strains: permanent and temporary. A permanent power-up is one that remains with the avatar for the remainder of the game (or at least the current life or level). Space Tripper (and many other shoot 'em-ups) uses this model. Space Tripper is unique, however, in that when the avatar dies, only power-ups gained on that level are lost.

Temporary power-ups are usually short lived (anything from a few seconds up to a couple of minutes) and provide the avatar with a powerful advantage for a short time (such as shields). The general rule is that the more powerful the advantage, the shorter the time it is available for. The Quad Damage power-up in Quake III is a perfect example of this. An alternative to the time limit is to allow a certain amount of usage. For example, shields may be used up after they are powered on for a certain period of time, or after a certain number of hits.

One interesting aspect of power-ups that is used in quite a few games is the concept of power points. The player is awarded a certain number of "points" to spend on an upgrade, and then to a certain degree, the player is allowed to decide how he wants to upgrade his avatar. Space Tripper has two main weapons; the weapon that is currently selected is the one that is upgraded. Successful play requires that the player balance the upgrade points between both weapons.

A specialized case of the power-up is the combo move. This is more often found in fighting games, and is a power-up that relies on the skill of the player to execute a sequence of commands with exact timing. The reward for success is a special move that devastates the opponent's defenses. The effectiveness of the move is often related to the difficulty of execution—a period of time in which the avatar is open to attack. Thus, more difficult combos carry higher risk.

### Collectibles

Collectibles are bonus objects that allow the player to augment his score. They are not essential to the game, and are often used just to augment the player's score. The player is not penalized for failing to collect them, but if he can justify the risk, then the rewards are high.

In some cases, collectibles can unlock secret levels or cause special bonus events. For example, in Rainbow Islands, one means by which the player could kill enemies was by collapsing rainbows onto them. Enemies killed in this fashion deposited crystals that could be collected for bonus points. If these crystals were collected in the right order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), then a doorway to a secret level would be opened, which gave the player a huge score and a permanent secret power-up.

### Smart Bombs

Defender was the first game to introduce the concept of the smart bomb (see Figure 9.10). Smart bombs are used to get the player out of a difficult situation when no other options are available.

Figure 9.10. Defender.

graphics/09fig10.gif

Usually, the player is given a strictly limited number of smart bombs, and opportunities to replace them are either extremely rare or non-existent. The function of the smart bomb is to clear the area immediately surrounding the player of enemies. Usually, this means that the visible area is cleared entirely of enemies, but the range cleared does vary dependent on the game. Smart bombs should be used by the player only in dire emergencies when there are no other options available. The scarcity of availability is the primary mechanism available to enforce this.

### Hyperspace

Hyperspace is another mechanism for getting the player out of trouble. However, unlike the smart bomb, the hyperspace design element is just as likely to land the avatar in an equally difficult situation as it is to get it to safety.

The first commonly known game to make use of the hyperspace element was Asteroids, shown in Figure 9.11. When the avatar was in immediate danger of being destroyed by an oncoming asteroid, the player could hit the hyperspace button, which would instantly move the player to another part of the screen. The amount of times the player can hyperspace is unlimited. This is because the usefulness of the hyperspace is balanced out by the chances that the avatar could appear in a worse situation than before. Hence, the choice of whether to use the hyperspace is tempered by the risks involved in doing so. Ironically, the more necessary it is to use it (the more debris of the playfield), the more risk there is to the player.

Figure 9.11. Asteroids.

graphics/09fig11.gif

### Waves

During a level, the enemies that confront the player's avatar can be introduced in a number of ways (generally called waves). There are two common ways that this is achieved. The difference between these two methods is in how the enemies appear.

With the first method, the layout and scheduled appearance times of the enemies are (for the most part) pre-scripted. There are very little (if any) random materializations of enemies. This has been used in games from the original Space Invaders to more recent games such as Max Payne and many others. In these types of games, the points at which the enemies appear are predefined, and an integral part of the level design. Of course, once they do appear, they can either follow a previously scripted attack formation, or rely on their own AI to locate and attack the player.

The second way of approaching wave formation is to make the enemies materialize randomly. Usually, there is some sort of algorithm determining which sort of enemies will appear, in order to maintain some sort of smooth difficulty progression. Often, the location and type of the enemy is selected from a small pool of variants for the particular level, as defined by the designer.

With both methods, the general usage is as follows. Throughout a level, the enemies arrive in some sort of formation. These formations will vary in composition to include a selection of enemies appropriate to the current challenge level. As the game progresses further, the formation composition will include stronger enemies. In some cases, the earlier weaker enemies will be phased out of the line-up, because they will no longer provide an effective challenge to the player. The enemies increase in difficulty and numbers as the player progresses in an environment, reaching a peaked frenzy at the end of the level. After this point, the environment changes and the intensity reduces to the initial point or somewhere just a bit higher.

### The Big Boss

A traditional staple of action games are the boss characters. In many games, the end of a group of themed levels is guarded by a large enemy—the boss character—who is significantly harder to fight than any of the previously encountered enemies.

Defeating the boss takes the player to a new set of levels, with a different theme. Boss characters often can't be hurt by normal methods and require a special attack method to be damaged. For example, they could be invincible at certain times (i.e., Piranha Plants in Super Mario Sunshine can be hurt only when their mouths are open) or can be hurt only by certain weapons.

Often, the boss character is themed after the environment (or vice versa). For example, the first set of levels in Parasol Stars are themed after musical instruments. The left side of Figure 9.12 shows the first boss, which is in keeping with the musical theme.

Figure 9.12. The first bosses in Parasol Stars and Rainbow Islands.

Another boss design element that is used fairly frequently is to use a much bigger and stronger version of an enemy that the player has already encountered. The right side of Figure 9.12 shows a classic example, taken from Rainbow Islands. The first set of levels are garden themed (with the enemies being mainly insects and birds). One of the first enemies encountered is a spider. The boss character is simply a much larger version of that spider. This enhances the gameplay by allowing the player to predict some of the boss behavior, and gives him a small advantage in knowing what to expect—an advantage that would not be there if the boss was entirely unfamiliar, and the player had to learn his behavior from scratch.

Of course, many games aren't suited for such an unsubtle set of themed levels, but even so, the themed level and big boss are one of the mainstay design elements of action games. The pattern of a succession of levels increasing in difficulty and challenge to a climax with the boss, before starting again at a slightly lower difficulty level, is present in virtually every level-based action-based game today. This is shown in Figure 9.13.

### Wildcard Enemies

In order to break up the predictability of predefined waves, many games use a randomly spawned wildcard enemy to provide a fresh challenge to the player, and break up the predictability of wave-based gameplay.

For example, the Atari game Asteroids has predictable waves because, once they have appeared, the movement of the asteroids are completely deterministic—except at the instance where they are shot and break up into smaller asteroids. However, at random points during the wave, an enemy UFO appears and follows a non-deterministic path, shooting at the player.

Another example is the Galaxian dive-bombers that break away from the main body of the wave and swoop down on the player's avatar. Wildcard enemies are usually a completely different class of enemy from level bosses, in that they are normally mixed in with normal enemies, and behave in a somewhat random or unexpected way.

### Locked Door and Key

The player encounters a locked door that requires a key to open it. The key (which is not necessarily a physical key) is hidden somewhere in the level, and must be found in order to open the door.

This is a common method used to partition levels, and to control the player's progress in order to manage the gameplay delivery. This particular design element is often strung together in a sequence of several overlapping instances, where a key is used to open a door to give access to another key, which in turn opens another door that the player encountered previously. Doom is a particularly good example of this.

This design element should be used with caution. If it is used too liberally, then it tends to make the gameplay feel clichéd, tedious, and old-fashioned. However, it can be very effective if some originality is applied to the design element, specifically in terms of how you implement the door/key mechanism. Remember, it doesn't have to be a traditional door and key. That would be boring, and has been done too many times. A door and key are just a conceptual representation of a construct that requires an effort (the key) on the part of the player to pass an obstacle (the door). A slightly more creative example is the use of this design element in Grand Theft Auto III. To open up new cities for play, certain difficult missions must be completed first.

### Monster Generators

Gauntlet (and its various sequels) was one of the first games to feature a monster generator. The concept of a monster generator is simple: It's an object that generates fresh enemies to confront the player.

The monster generator isn't always visible: for example, enemy spawn points in games such as Doom are not explicit objects. Instead, the monsters just appear out of thin air in a flash of green light—usually out of the sight of the player.

The difference between the use of monster generators in Gauntlet and Doom is substantial. In Gauntlet, monster generators are an integral part of the gameplay—destroy the monster generators, and no more monsters will appear. Hence, the player has two main strategies: Fight the monsters, or destroy the generator. In terms of survival, the dominant strategy is to destroy the monster generators before they can spawn too many monsters, but if players are aiming for the high score, then they may hold off on destroying the monster generator until they have boosted their scores sufficiently. You can see in this case that the monster generators are not only an integral part of the gameplay, but they can play a strategic role too.

In Doom, however, the monster generators are much more behind the scenes. All players know is that monsters are appearing—they are not given the opportunity to destroy the generators to prevent this from happening. The only sensible strategy under these circumstances is to avoid or destroy the monsters, and get to the level exit as quickly as possible.

Monster generators—whether represented by a physical object or not—can have other attributes too. The most obvious of these is whether the generator will spawn an infinite number of monsters or just a limited amount before being spent. If the monster generator spawns infinitely, then you may want to consider the possibility of allowing the player to destroy it.

Another consideration is whether the monster generator will spawn only one type of enemy, or whether it has a range of enemies at its disposal. This can either be a static relationship or can be tied in with the difficulty level.

### Dungeon Exits and Level Warps

The dungeon exit signifies a transition within the game. Usually, this transition involves progressing to a new level, or a new area within the current level. The dungeon exit design element often is used as a goal or sub-goal of the current level. In other cases, it is merely an enabler, allowing the player to move between different areas while she attempts to complete other goals.

The dungeon exit is usually guarded by enemies and/or is well-hidden. The strength of the guard force and the difficulty in locating an exit is usually in direct relationship to the benefits of locating it. A common variant on this element is to provide more than one exit to a certain level. One of these is the standard exit, which takes the player to the next level. The second is a warp exit, which will jump the player ahead several levels. This second exit (often visible when you find the first) is difficult to reach, and requires extra sacrifice on the part of the player. The reward is usually proportional to the level of sacrifice, and this particular variation has been used in many games—from Defender: Stargate (allowing experienced players to warp ahead to the more challenging levels) to Gauntlet (where alternative exits would jump the player ahead by a few levels for the same reasons as Stargate) to games such as Luigi's Mansion and the Super Mario series (where some levels have hidden exits that lead to secret areas). If there is a hidden exit, you may want to give the player a subtle clue. For example, in Super Mario World, levels with secret exits are shown as flashing red dots (rather than flashing yellow dots) on the world overview map.

### Mini-Maps

As action games became more complex, the play area began to span multiple screens of action, although the player still needed to be aware of what was going on in the game-world not visible onscreen.

The solution to this was to place a small dynamically updated map or radar display in the status display. There are several common configurations used for this. The original configuration was used in Defender and showed the entire game world to the player. Another configuration does not show the entire game world to the player, merely showing a zoomed-out view of the area surrounding the player. Williams' Sinistar used this approach, augmented with a text status line to notify the player of important events occurring outside of the scanner range.

A third configuration that we'll mention here—although it is used more often in other genres that are not so action oriented—is to have the map build up as the player explores. Areas that the player has not yet visited do not show up on the map. When the player visits them, they are drawn, and the map remains in the same form and is not updated further until the player revisits the area.

## Victory Conditions

Action games—being among the first of the genres—benefited well from the early experimental years of the industry. The plots and settings of the early action games were many and varied, usually very original, and with the amount of extraneous story kept to a minimum; consequently, the nature of the victory conditions were for the most part simple and clear. The vast majority of games have a clear set of victory conditions, which are made clear to the player from the outset. In some cases—particularly in the case of action games—these victory conditions are illusory. For example, the accompanying blurb for Space Invaders talks about the player saving the Earth from the evil alien invaders. However, as anyone who has played the game is aware, after you've saved the Earth from one wave of evil invaders, another appears to take their place. And so on, ad infinitum, with each wave getting faster and more aggressive, until the player is overwhelmed.

Case Study 9.1 A Flawed Victory Condition

In some games, the victory condition is a result of a bug that prevents the player from progressing any further. This is surprisingly common, due to the fact that the developers of such games usually didn't test that far into the game. The most well-known example of this is probably Pac-Man.

For years, people have been attempting to get a perfect score on Pac-Man. In July of 1999, Billy Mitchell of Fort Lauderdale, Florida scored a perfect 3,333,360 points on a Pac-Man machine in Weirs Beach, New Hampshire. The perfect score is achieved by playing for six hours, through 256 levels of Pac-Man, eating every pellet, power-pill, blue ghost, and piece of fruit on every single level, without dying once. After the 256th level, the game freezes.

When he stepped away from the game after beating it, he said "I never have to play that darn game again…".

What can be derived from this is the observation that action games generally have one or zero victory conditions. They are split into two broad classes: those that are possible to win, and those where it is possible only to attain the highest score. Most early action games were of the latter class—mainly due to memory constraints. In later years, when the processing power and storage capabilities increased, developers began incorporating structured stories into their games—and with stories, come endings. Games such as Golden Axe (shown in Figure 9.14) had definite endings where, after the defeat of the big bad end-of-game boss (in this case, Death Adder), the players' avatars lived happily ever after (until the inevitable sequel comes along, of course).

As such, action games are unusual because the victory conditions are either crystal clear and known to the player in advance, or completely non-existent, being wrapped in an amorphous goal that can never be attained, such as the previously mentioned Space Invaders. Finding something between these two extremes is rare, mainly because it pushes the game away from being a pure action game into another genre entirely.


### Interaction Model

The primary model in action games is based purely on fast interactions—hand-eye coordination and reaction speed. The ability to think quickly and analyze situations almost instantaneously is favored as well. The player is usually given direct control over a single avatar. In order to efficiently translate the player's intent into actions within the game, the control methods for action games are usually extremely simple. Even so, various action games have attempted to implement more complex control schemes. The success of these games depended on the lengths to which players were prepared to go to learn the system. Games that succeed in this are usually the games that set the standards for new genres. For example, the Doom and Quake modes of interaction for FPS games are pretty much ubiquitous nowadays. Similarly, the Super Mario 64 control system has become the de facto standard control system for most console-based 3D platform games.

Often, the ability to analyze the situation in a particular game is a learned process developed through playing that particular game. In some cases, the skills learned playing one game can be applied to other games, with varying levels of transferability. For example, the skills learned when playing Space Invaders can be transferred wholesale over to other games such as Galaxians and, to a lesser extent, Centipede. There are several levels to the nature of the skills developed by playing certain games, and these levels are linked to how domain-specific the skills are. For example, the skill of picking off the spider in Centipede is not that useful in many other action games. Conversely, the skill of navigating the player's avatar and picking off a target further up the screen is useful in a much wider range of games. Obviously, if similar games use similar control systems, then the cross-game transfer of these skills is that much easier.

Of course, the ability to analyze a complex play-situation instantaneously is of limited use if the player has poor hand-eye coordination and reaction times. Studies tend to be conflicted on whether games improve or reduce these attributes in regular players. Common sense seems to indicate that exercising a skill tends to improve it, but what the official line is on this matter depends on the flavor of this month's study.

## Perspective

Action games, whether directly or indirectly, are intended to be played from the viewpoint of the avatar. This is obvious when it comes to 3D FPS games such as Quake. You are looking through the eyes of your character—there's no other way to interpret it. Unfortunately, despite protests to the contrary, the FPS 3D view is probably one of the most unrealistic views possible. We do not dispute the aesthetics of this viewpoint—in fact, we believe it is excellent for immersion in a game world, but in strictly purist terms, it is simply not realistic.

The average human has 120 degrees of vision and can detect movement in the peripheral field at up to 180 degrees laterally. The average game of Quake shows a 30-degree view—not to mention the fact that your ability to control the character is solely provided via a keyboard/mouse interface. Compared to the freedom of view and subtle nuance of movement in the real world, in the game world, your avatar is a tunnel-visioned paraplegic in an electric wheelchair.

Some 3D games, such as Super Mario Sunshine, Max Payne, and the Tomb Raider series, offer a third-person view. The player can see her avatar onscreen. Aside from niggling issues with camera control, this is probably the closest perspective to natural vision. Players can see clearly ahead of them, and they also are provided with limited awareness of what is behind and to the side of them. The only fly in the ointment as far as this particular scheme goes is the camera. A good camera can make or break a third-person view game. If the player is to feel as if she is part of the action rather than a disjointed observer, then the camera must be as unobtrusive as possible. An obvious camera adds an extra degree of complexity for understanding the world—another obstacle in the way of gameplay. Giving the player control of the camera is not a solution—it's merely a quick patch of a broken feature.

For an action game, sometimes it's just not enough to give the player a view that is close to reality. In order to make the game manageable, it's necessary to give the player super-human vision. That sounds like a good justification for the 2D viewpoint, but really it is just a rationalization after the fact. 2D action games were often so frenetic simply because of the super-human viewpoint that they offered the player.

Humans are creatures capable of thinking in three dimensions. Hence, displaying a representation of a system in 2D instantly confers an advantage. There is an order of magnitude less complexity for the player to cope with in terms of object positioning. This means that 2D action games can afford to throw a lot more at the player before overwhelming them than an equivalent 3D game.

## User Interface Design

In principle, user interface design for action games is extremely straightforward. It should follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to the letter. The user interface should be as minimalist as possible. In order for the player to be able to effectively play the game, he needs to able to accurately and quickly assess the play environment.

All the information that the player needs to be able to access in order to be effective at the game should be immediately present onscreen. Most action games require only a limited amount of information, so this isn't difficult to achieve. For example, the HUD (Heads-Up Display) for Quake III shows the minimum amount of information. Basically, it shows the player's current health, weapon, and amount of ammo. Don't try to show too much information to the player at one time. Not only does the player have to contend with the frantic action in the game, but he also has to pay attention to the indicators in the status panel. He should be able to do this at a glance, without having to work to interpret the information. Use simple schemes to get the required information across. One way you can do this is to use colors wherever possible to indicate changing situations, rather than textual or numerical methods. Another important situation to consider is when the player's attention needs to be attracted quickly to a changing status panel, especially when the panel is outside the main field of peripheral vision of the player; then he will be concentrating on the in-game action, not the status panel. If you need the player to notice something in the status panel, then you'll need to take appropriate measures. Within the main focus of view of the player, the eyes are sensitive to color and shape. Outside of this region, the eye is attuned to detect changes in contrast or color, so the easiest way to draw the attention of the player is to use a flashing or flickering indicator.

In some cases, additional information (too much to appear comfortably in one small status panel) is required. This should be avoided whenever possible, but when it is not possible to avoid, it must be handled carefully so as not to disrupt the flow of the game to the detriment of the player. If the player loses out by having to switch to a secondary map or status screen, then the enjoyment of the game is impacted. For example, in many FPS games, the level map is shown on a separate screen that obscures the main view. This means that the player has to be in a safe position to look at the map safely. Other games use a transparent overlay to display the same map information. Often, this is the ideal presentation method, as it allows the player to clearly see both the surrounding environment and the map. However, its effectiveness is limited if the map is so complex that it obscures the main view too much.

Another golden rule for action games is that the player avatar must be extremely easy to pick out. In the case of FPS games, this is easy—the avatar is the player, looking out through the screen. This is the exception, however. In every other type of action game, the avatar is displayed onscreen. In almost all cases, the avatar looks unique—it has a unique shape or position onscreen. However, the most effective way of ensuring that an avatar is easily discernable is use of color. For example, Lara Croft is the only entity onscreen in Tomb Raider wearing a light blue shirt. This means that if the player can see a splash of that particular light blue on the screen, then he is looking at Lara. This also means that Lara is immediately identifiable onscreen without any conscious thought process on the part of the player. In other games—for example, in the case of two-dimensional scrolling games—the avatar is often distinguished by position. It is always in the same absolute position—or at least on the same horizontal or vertical line—onscreen, and the world moves around it. This gives players a fixed point of reference about which to orient themselves.

Not only is it important to be able to pick out the avatar, but it is also extremely important to be able to quickly identify enemies. There are several mechanisms in use for this. The majority of action games use color schemes to achieve this. As mentioned previously, the avatar is often a unique color. An extension of this scheme is to ensure that enemies follow a common scheme of color or appearance. Think of the film Tron—you can easily identify the bad guys because they're the ones in red. The good guys are in blue. This is a throwback to the old spaghetti westerns where the good guys wore white and the bad guys wore black. A similar scheme can also be used for collectible items. In fact, an often-used scheme is to have the avatar predominantly one color and all collectibles another color, with the majority of the background yet another color. Anything else is an enemy. Of course, this is mainly used in older games, and is often tied to hardware limitations (as in Pac-Man). There is no reason to use this particular configuration, however, and it can be shuffled around, as long as it is consistent. For example, each level of Space Tripper uses unique color schemes for the enemies, collectibles, and avatar designed to have maximum contrast with the level scenery. In this way, it is easy for the player to analyze the playing environment as easily as possible. The only problem with this is the issue of color-blindness. Relying solely on color as a differentiating indicator excludes a significant section of potential game players. Use form and contrast in tandem with color to maximize the differentiation methods available to players. Of course, color blindness typically affects only 10% of males (and even fewer females), and usually only affects the ability to differentiate red from green (and dependent colors). Other colors (with little or no red/green component, such as shades of blue) are safe to use.

Action games (with one notable exception) require simple controls. Because of the fast-action nature of these games, the controls should, wherever possible, directly translate to avatar actions—pushing left on the controls makes the avatar go left, pushing right makes the avatar go right, and so on. For 2D games, this is a fairly simple endeavor, but for first- or third-person 3D games, there is an additional complication caused by the third dimension. There will always be an extra level of indirection for the player to deal with, and the controls will not be as intuitive as a 2D game. Quake-style games, even though they have standardized on a fairly logically consistent control system, are by no means simple for a complete beginner. Learning to use the Quake-style interface is the biggest barrier to mass-market success for first-person 3D games. For example, consider the success of the Mario series of games on the early Nintendo console systems. Super Mario World on the SNES was a system-seller. On the strength of that game alone, Nintendo sold many SNES systems. However, the first 3D incarnation of the Mario series, Super Mario 64, was not as immediately successful, even though the control system was as close to optimal as could be hoped. It was helped somewhat by the sheer eye-candy and novelty value, but for the average player, it was nowhere near as "pick up and play" as the earlier games, partially due to the added complexity of managing the camera as well as Mario.

The notable exception to the simple control systems mentioned previously is the specific sub-genre of fighting games. For these, moves such as walking, kicking, and punching are fairly straightforward to perform. But for the more complex and rewarding combo moves, those that can cause more damage to the opponent (and usually carry a correspondingly higher risk due to taking longer to perform), the player is expected to perform a long string of commands in the correct sequence in order to be able to pull off the advanced move.

At the other end of the spectrum are games in which the player's movements are directly emulated in the game. Without considering VR systems, a mass-market example of this is the arcade game Dance Dance Revolution. This is controlled by a set of footpads that the player has to dance upon in attempts to match the flashing icons that appear on the screen. Consequently, the player's avatar is controlled directly by the dancing (or more accurately, stomping) of the player.

Special Design Considerations for Action Games

We've already covered most of the design considerations for action games in this chapter, but there is one important point that we have not yet considered. If we compare a game such as Defender with a game such as Super Mario World (aside from the cutesy graphics of the latter), when just watching them being played, one would appear to be more difficult than the other.

Defender is a very unforgiving game. It tolerates no mistakes on the part of the player. If the player makes a mistake, then the player loses a life. End of story.

Super Mario World, however, is a lot more tolerant of player mistakes. The difficulty of some of the tougher levels are on a par with those of Defender, so it's not just a simple matter of the game being easier to play. No, the difference between these two games is the "perceived difficulty." Determining the perceived difficulty of a game is fundamentally the answer to the following two questions: What is the learning curve for the beginning player? How difficult is it for the player to recover from mistakes?

In Defender, the player is dropped into the thick of the action with no gentle introductions, and a mistake costs a life. In Super Mario World, the difficulty of the first few levels is gently ramped, and mistakes on the part of the player are tolerated. For example, if a player guides Mario too close to the edge of a platform, he has the chance to correct the error because Mario teeters on the edge for a second before dropping.

The target market for a game often decides which of these two extremes it will follow. Defender was an arcade game, designed to generate maximum coin throughput. Super Mario World was aimed at young players, and as such was designed to be easily accessible—the clichéd "easy to learn and difficult to master."

Action Game Worksheet

As you design an action game, consider the following questions:

1. Is this game a shooter or a non-shooter? If it is a non-shooter, what actions will the player take to defeat enemies?
2. Is the world (not the display mechanism) essentially 2D or 3D? If the world is 2D, should the display mechanism be 2D also, or would the gameplay benefit from 3D graphics?
3. If the world is 2D, will the whole world be visible on the screen, or will it scroll? If it scrolls, in which direction(s) does it scroll?
4. Does the player need a mini-map to see key offscreen elements of the world before they arrive onscreen? What about an automap for allowing him to record where he has been?
5. What physical challenges will the game incorporate, and under what circumstances? Speed and reaction time? Accurate steering and aiming? Timing? Combo moves?
6. Will enemies appear in waves? Will there be monster generators or wildcard enemies to break up the regular progression of the waves?
7. Will the game be broken into levels? What things will make one level different from another (landscape, enemies, speed, perspective, and so on)? Don't forget cosmetic items like music and architecture. Will levels end with a boss?
8. How will the avatar's life be managed: as fixed lives, energy bars, or some combination? Can the player obtain more lives? If so, how?
9. What power-ups will there be, if any? For each one you plan to incorporate, do the following: state what it does, what it looks like, what it sounds like when activated or how or where it is to be found or obtained, how common or rare it is, how long its effect lasts, and how the player will be able to identify it (by sight and the sound it makes).
10. Will the game give the player clues that allow him to anticipate challenges, or must the player depend entirely on trial-and-error to learn his way through it?
11. Does the game involve exploring unknown territory? If so, how linear or non-linear will it be? Traditional arcade and side-scrolling games gave little or no choice; games like Spyro the Dragon offer considerable freedom.
12. Is there a save-game or checkpoint mechanism that prevents the player from having to start over from the beginning?
13. Is the player going to collect anything, in either large or small numbers? Can collected items be "exchanged" for anything useful, or is the player awarded anything when particular thresholds are reached?
14. Is there a scoring mechanism? If so, how is it computed? Does it serve any function besides giving the player a record of achievement?
15. What "locked doors" will there be, and what "keys" will open them?
16. Will the game have, or need, a tutorial mode? If not, how steep do you want the learning curve to be?
17. Does the game have a victory condition other than simple survival? What is it?
