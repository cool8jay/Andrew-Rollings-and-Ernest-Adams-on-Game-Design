# Chapter 3. Game Settings and Worlds 第三章：游戏场景与世界

A game world is an artificial universe, an imaginary place whose creation begins with the (usually unspoken) words “Let's pretend….” Every game, no matter how small, takes place in a world. Most games have a physical, or at least a visible, manifestation of this world: a set of cards, a board, or an image on a computer screen. Even tic-tac-toe, one of the simplest games imaginable, has a world—a little diagram governed by rules and a victory condition. The boundaries of the diagram are the boundaries of the world. Any marks that you make outside of them are not part of the game.

游戏世界是一个人造的宇宙，是一个想象中的地方，它的创造始于“让我们假装……”（通常是不经意的）一句话。每款游戏，无论多小，都发生在一个世界里。大多数游戏都有一个物理世界，或者至少是一个可见的世界：一套牌、一个棋盘，或者电脑屏幕上的一个图像。即使是井字棋这种可以想象到的最简单的游戏也有一个世界——一个由规则和胜利条件支配的小图。图的边界就是世界的边界。你在图外所做的任何标记都不是游戏的一部分。

The football field defines the physical boundaries of the football game's world. The football game's world is also bounded by time: It has a beginning and an end. When the clock runs out, the world ceases to exist; the game is over. The game can also be interrupted; during a timeout, the world freezes. It still exists in the minds of the players and the spectators—the game is still in progress—but no change can take place within the world until the timeout is over.

足球场定义了足球游戏世界的物理边界。足球游戏的世界也以时间为边界：它有开始和结束。当时间耗尽时，世界就不复存在，比赛也就结束了。比赛也会中断；在暂停期间，世界会冻结。它仍然存在于球员和观众的脑海中——比赛仍在进行，但在暂停结束之前，世界不会发生任何变化。

Not all game worlds have a visible component. The game Twenty Questions consists only of some basic rules and a victory condition, but it still has a world and the world has boundaries. If you're playing Twenty Questions and the questioner asks, “Wanna go surfing after work?,” most people would say that the question lies outside the game world. It doesn't count as one of the 20 allowed. A text adventure is another game defined by words; the world is created in the player's imagination when he reads the text on the screen. A few master chess players can play in their heads, with no board at all—another example of a game world with no physical component.

并非所有游戏世界都有可见的组成部分。游戏《二十个问题》只有一些基本规则和一个胜利条件，但它仍然有一个世界，而这个世界是有边界的。如果你在玩“二十个问题”游戏，提问者问：“下班后想去冲浪吗？”，大多数人会说这个问题不属于游戏世界。它不算是 20 个问题中的一个。文字冒险游戏是另一种由文字定义的游戏；当玩家阅读屏幕上的文字时，世界就在玩家的想象中产生了。一些国际象棋大师可以在脑中下棋，根本不需要棋盘——这也是游戏世界没有物理组成部分的另一个例子。

The setting of a game is its fictional component, that aspect of the game that is a fantasy. Tic-tac-toe has no setting, nor does Twenty Questions; when you play them, you're not pretending to be anywhere else or to do anything besides what you're doing. Chess has just a scrap of a setting; although the board and the moves are abstract, the pieces have names that suggest a medieval court with its king and queen, knights and bishops. Stratego has even more of a setting. The pieces in Stratego are numbered, and you could play the game completely abstractly—my number 5 takes your number 6, and so on—but Milton Bradley has chosen to paint little pictures on them, encouraging us to pretend that they are colonels and sergeants and scouts in an army.

游戏的背景是其虚构的组成部分，是游戏的幻想部分。井字棋没有背景，《二十个问题》也没有；当你玩这些游戏时，你并没有假装在其他任何地方，也没有做任何你正在做的事情以外的事情。国际象棋只有一点点背景；虽然棋盘和走法都很抽象，但棋子的名字却让人联想到中世纪宫廷里的国王和王后、骑士和主教。西洋陆军棋的背景则更加丰富。西洋陆军棋中的棋子是有编号的，你可以完全抽象地玩这个游戏——我的 5 号吃掉你的 6 号，以此类推——但米尔顿·布拉德利选择在棋子上画上小图画，鼓励我们假装它们是军队中的上校、军士和侦察兵。

# The Purpose of a Game Setting 游戏设置的目的

Games exist to entertain, and the entertainment value of a game is derived from several sources: its gameplay, its story, social interaction (if it is a multi-player game), and so on. The setting also contributes to the entertainment that the game provides. In a game such as chess, almost all the entertainment value is in the gameplay; few people think of it as a game about medieval warfare. In an adventure game such as Escape from Monkey Island, the setting is essential to the fantasy. Without the setting, Escape from Monkey Island would not exist, and if it had a different setting, it would be a different game.

游戏是为了娱乐而存在的，而游戏的娱乐价值来自多个方面：游戏玩法、故事情节、社交互动（如果是多人游戏）等等。游戏环境也有助于提高游戏的娱乐性。在国际象棋这样的游戏中，几乎所有的娱乐价值都体现在游戏性上；很少有人会认为这是一款关于中世纪战争的游戏。而在《逃离猴岛》这样的冒险游戏中，环境对于奇幻游戏来说至关重要。没有背景，《逃离猴岛》就不存在，而如果有不同的背景，它就会是另一款游戏。

As a general rule, the more a game depends on its core mechanics to entertain, the less its setting matters. Mastering the core mechanics requires a kind of abstract thought, and fantasy can be a distraction. Serious chess players aren't interested in the shape of the chessmen; their shapes don't contribute significantly to the game. A serious chess player can have just as much fun with a $2 plastic travel chess set as with a $200 inlaid wooden board and solid pewter statues for pieces. As players learn to understand the core mechanics of other games, they stop thinking about the fantasy element as well. When players become highly skilled at a game such as Quake III, they no longer think about the fact that they're pretending to be space marines in a futuristic environment; they think only about hiding, moving, shooting, ambushing, obtaining more ammunition, and so on.

一般来说，游戏的娱乐性越依赖于其核心机制，其背景就越不重要。掌握核心机制需要一种抽象思维，而幻想会分散注意力。严肃的棋手对棋子的形状并不感兴趣，因为它们的形状对游戏的贡献并不大。一个严肃的棋手可以用一套 2 美元的塑料旅行棋，也可以用一套 200 美元的镶嵌木质棋盘和实心锡制雕像棋子，获得同样多的乐趣。当玩家学会理解其他游戏的核心机制时，他们也就不再考虑幻想元素了。当玩家熟练掌握《雷神之锤3》等游戏时，他们就不会再考虑自己是在未来环境中扮演太空陆战队员这一事实；他们只会考虑躲藏、移动、射击、伏击、获取更多弹药等等。

This process of abstraction—ignoring the game's setting—occurs only at a high level of play, however. To someone who's playing a game for the first time, the setting is vital to creating and sustaining his interest. One of the essential functions of a game's setting is actually to sell the game in the first place. It's not the game's mechanics that make a customer pick up a box in a store, but the fantasy it offers: who you'll be, where you'll be, and what you'll be doing there if you play that game.

然而，这种抽象化过程——忽视游戏背景——只有在高水平的游戏中才会出现。对于第一次玩游戏的人来说，游戏的背景对于激发和维持他的兴趣至关重要。实际上，游戏背景的基本功能之一首先是推销游戏。让顾客在商店里拿起一盒游戏的不是游戏的机制，而是它提供的幻想：如果你玩了这款游戏，你会成为谁，你会在哪里，你会在那里做什么。

## The “Graphics Versus Gameplay” Debate “图形与游戏性”之争

The relationship between the setting and the mechanics is the subject of considerable debate in the game industry, although it's usually characterized as “graphics versus gameplay.” The graphics create the setting; the core mechanics, along with the user interface, create the gameplay—the challenges the player faces and the actions he may take to overcome them. In the early days of video gaming, graphics were seriously restricted by the weakness of the display hardware. The gameplay, as implemented by the programmers, was the source of most of the game's appeal. With the growth of modern display technology, the graphics have taken on much greater importance, and creating them consumes a large proportion of a game's development budget. Some designers and programmers, especially those who've been around since the early days, have become rather annoyed at the dominant role that graphics now play. They insist that graphics must be subordinate to gameplay in game design, and as proof they point to examples of games with great graphics and very little gameplay that offer poor value for the money.

在游戏行业中，背景与机制之间的关系一直是争论不休的话题，不过这种争论通常被称为“图形与游戏性”之争。图形创造了环境，而核心机制和用户界面则创造了游戏性——玩家面临的挑战和克服挑战的行动。在早期的视频游戏中，图形受到显示硬件薄弱的严重限制。由程序员实现的游戏性才是游戏吸引力的源泉。随着现代显示技术的发展，图形的重要性大大提高，制作图形耗费了游戏开发预算的很大一部分。一些设计师和程序员，尤其是那些早期的设计师和程序员，对图形现在所起的主导作用感到非常恼火。他们坚持认为，在游戏设计中，图形必须从属于游戏性，并举出一些游戏例子，它们具有出色的图形效果，但游戏性却很低，性价比很低。

This was a serious problem in the early 1990s, when Hollywood studios thought they could take over the game industry because they were better able to create impressive graphics than the game publishers. However, they failed. Hollywood didn't understand software engineering, didn't understand interactivity, and, most important, didn't understand gameplay. The public refused to accept games with bad gameplay, no matter how spectacular the graphics were. After a few false starts, Hollywood learned to work with game publishers rather than trying to become game publishers, realizing that the two groups bring complementary skills to creating games.

这在 20 世纪 90 年代初是一个严重的问题，当时好莱坞工作室认为他们可以接管游戏产业，因为他们比游戏发行商更有能力制作出令人印象深刻的画面。然而，他们失败了。好莱坞不懂软件工程，不懂互动性，最重要的是不懂游戏性。公众拒绝接受游戏性差的游戏，无论其画面多么精彩。在经历了几次失败之后，好莱坞学会了与游戏发行商合作，而不是试图成为游戏发行商，因为他们意识到，这两个群体在创造游戏方面的技能是互补的。

We believe the "graphics versus gameplay" debate is no longer a meaningful one. The truth is that graphics and gameplay must work together to produce the total play experience. The graphics create the setting, which both sells the game and involves the player in the game's fantasy. The gameplay provides the challenge and things for the player to do. Both are essential to the player's enjoyment of the game. The graphics bring in the player, and the gameplay keeps him there.

我们认为，“图形与游戏性”的争论已不再有意义。事实是，画面和游戏性必须相互配合，才能产生全面的游戏体验。画面创造了环境，既推销了游戏，又让玩家参与到游戏的幻想中。游戏玩法则为玩家提供了挑战和活动。两者对于玩家享受游戏都至关重要。画面吸引玩家，而游戏玩法则让玩家留在游戏中。

## Immersiveness and Suspension of Disbelief 沉浸感和信任感

A key part of the experience of reading a novel or watching a movie is suspension of disbelief. Suspension of disbelief is a mental state in which you choose, for a period of time, to believe that this pack of lies, this fiction, is reality. This applies to games as well. When you go inside the game world and temporarily make it your reality, you suspend your disbelief. The better a game supports the illusion, the more thoroughly engrossed you become, and then the more immersive we say the game is. Immersiveness is one of the holy grails of game design.

阅读小说或观看电影的一个重要体验就是信任感。信任感是一种心理状态，在这种状态下，你会在一段时间内选择相信这一切谎言、虚构是真实的。这也适用于游戏。当你进入游戏世界，并暂时把它当作现实时，你就暂缓了你的怀疑。游戏对这种幻觉的支持越好，你就会越彻底地沉迷其中，然后我们就会说这款游戏沉浸感越强。沉浸感是游戏设计的圣杯之一。

> 译者注：suspension of disbelief，直译是终止怀疑，由萨缪尔·泰勒·柯勒律治（Samuel Taylor Coleridge）提出,指读者或观众在面对虚构作品时，尽管明知故事情节是假的，却主动选择暂时相信这个虚假现实，以浸入其中。可以简化为“信任感”。

Movies and novels try to create the impression that what they depict is real, though fantasy and science fiction novels rather test our patience in this regard. Few movies and novels specifically allude to the fact that they are fiction; they try to preserve the suspension of disbelief. Some deliberately play with the idea. Both the book and the movie The French Lieutenant's Woman specifically alluded to the fact that they were works of fiction, wrenching the audience out of the work's Victorian setting to encourage comparisons with today's world. The movie The Stunt Man similarly kept the viewer—and the movie's hero—off balance, unable to tell whether what we were seeing was supposed to be reality or merely a movie being filmed.

电影和小说试图给人一种印象，即它们所描绘的都是真实的，尽管奇幻和科幻小说在这方面相当考验我们的耐心。很少有电影和小说明确暗示它们是虚构的；它们试图保持信任感。有些电影和小说则故意玩弄这一概念。小说和电影《法国中尉的女人》和电影都特别暗示了它们是虚构作品的事实，将观众从作品的维多利亚时代背景中拉出来，鼓励他们与当今世界进行比较。电影《特技演员》同样让观众和电影主人公失去平衡，分不清我们看到的是现实还是正在拍摄中的电影。

More often, however, suspension of disbelief is broken by poor design. This might occur if one of the people in the story does something that is wildly out of character, or if something highly improbable happens—a deus ex machina—and we are expected to accept it as normal. Another thing that frequently destroys a player's suspension of disbelief or prevents it from ever forming is a lack of harmony, which we discuss next.

然而，更常见的情况是，信任感被拙劣的设计所打破。如果故事中的某个人做出了与角色大相径庭的事情，或者发生了非常不可能发生的事情——一个天神显灵——而我们却要把它当作正常的事情来接受，就会出现这种情况。另一个经常破坏玩家终止怀疑或者阻碍其形成的原因是缺乏和谐，我们将在下文中讨论。

> 译者注：deus ex machina，直译是机械降神，一种意想不到的力量或事件拯救了看似绝望的局面，尤其是作为戏剧或小说中人为的情节技巧。比如，角色从悬崖掉下去，突然出现一个飞行机器人接住他，那就是机械神。

## The Importance of Harmony 和谐的重要性

Good games and game worlds possess harmony, a quality first identified by the legendary game designer Brian Moriarty. Harmony is the feeling that all parts of the game belong to a single, coherent whole. In his lecture “Listen: The Potential of Shared Hallucinations,” Moriarty explained the concept of harmony so well that, with his permission, we use his own words to describe it:

优秀的游戏和游戏世界具有和谐性，这是传奇游戏设计师布莱恩·莫里亚蒂最先发现的一种品质。和谐是一种感觉，即游戏的所有部分都属于一个统一的整体。布莱恩·莫里亚蒂在他的演讲《倾听：共享幻觉的潜力》中，对和谐的概念做了很好的诠释，经他同意，我们用他自己的话来描述和谐：

Harmony isn't something you can fake. You don't need anyone to tell you if it's there or not. Nobody can sell it to you, it's not an intellectual exercise. It's a sensual, intuitive experience. It's something you feel. How do you achieve that feeling that everything works together? Where do you get this harmony stuff?

和谐不能伪造。你不需要任何人告诉你它是否存在。没有人可以向你推销它，它不是一种智力练习。它是一种感性的、直观的体验。这是你的感觉。你是如何实现这种感觉的？你从哪里得到这种和谐？

Well, I'm here to tell you that it doesn't come from design committees. It doesn't come from focus groups or market surveys. It doesn't come from cool technology or expensive marketing. And it never happens by accident or by luck. Games with harmony emerge from a fundamental note of clear intention. From design decisions based on an ineffable sense of proportion and rightness. Its presence produces an emotional resonance with its audience. A sense of inner unity that has nothing to do with what or how you did something, it has something to do with why. Myst and Gemstone both have harmony. They have it, because their makers had a vision of the experience they were trying to achieve and the confidence to attain it. They laid down a solid, ambient groove that players and their respective markets can relate to emotionally. They resisted the urge to overbuild. They didn't pile on a lot of gratuitous features just so they could boast about them. And they resisted the temptation to employ inappropriate emotional effects. Effects like shock violence, bad language, inside humor.

好吧，我在这里告诉你，它不是来自设计委员会。它不是来自焦点小组或市场调查。它不是来自炫酷的技术或昂贵的市场营销。它也从来不是偶然或运气使然。和谐的游戏来自于明确的基本意图。它来自于基于不可言喻的比例感和正确性的设计决策。它的存在能与受众产生情感共鸣。一种内在的统一感，它与你做了什么或如何做无关，而是与为什么有关。《神秘岛》和《宝石》都具有和谐感。它们之所以和谐，是因为它们的制作者对所要实现的体验有着远见卓识，并有信心实现这一目标。他们奠定了坚实的氛围基础，让玩家和各自的市场在情感上产生共鸣。他们克制住了过度设计的冲动。他们没有堆砌无用功能来炫耀自己。他们抵制了使用不恰当的情感效果的诱惑，比如震撼的暴力、粗俗的语言、内部笑话。

You know, the suspension of disbelief is fragile. It's hard to achieve it, and hard to maintain. One bit of unnecessary gore, one hip colloquialism, one reference to anything outside the imaginary world you've created is enough to destroy that world. These cheap effects are the most common indicators of a lack of vision or confidence. People who put this stuff into their games are not working hard enough.

要知道，信任感是很脆弱的。很难做到，也很难维持。一点不必要的血腥场面，一句时髦的口语，一次对你所创造的想象世界之外的任何事物的提及，都足以摧毁这个世界。这些糟糕的结果是缺乏远见或信心的最常见表现。往游戏里加入这些东西的人并没有足够努力。

Harmony is essential for a good game world. With every design decision you make, you should ask yourself whether the result is in harmony with your overall vision. Too many games have elements that seem bolted on, last-minute ideas that somebody thought would be “cool” to include. Although every game design requires compromises, as we said in [Chapter 1](chapter-1.md), “What Is Game Design?,” an important part of your job as a designer is to minimize the false notes or off-key elements that compromises tend to create. Try to find a way to make everything fit together into a coherent, integrated whole.

好的游戏世界离不开和谐。在做每一个设计决定时，你都应该问问自己，结果是否与你的整体愿景和谐一致。太多游戏中的元素似乎是临时拼凑的，是某些人认为“很酷”的想法。尽管正如我们在[第一章](chapter-1.md)，“什么是游戏设计？”中所说的那样，每个游戏设计都需要妥协，但作为设计师，你工作的一个重要任务就是尽量减少妥协带来的假音或跑调元素。努力找到一种方法，让所有东西都能融为一体，成为一个连贯的整体。

A good way to identify games with harmony is to look for those that have lasted far longer in the marketplace than their designers ever expected. This means that something about the game is striking a resonant chord with its players, a chord that continues to echo. For example, people continue to make modifications to Half-Life that are actually more popular than new games because Half-Life is such an elegant, harmonious game. Tetris is another case in point. Action games come and go, but Tetris has stood the test of time and might outlive us all.

识别和谐游戏的一个好方法是寻找那些在市场上持续时间远远超过设计者预期的游戏。这意味着游戏中的某些东西引起了玩家的共鸣，而且这种共鸣还在持续回荡。例如，人们不断对《半条命》进行修改，而这些修改实际上比新游戏更受欢迎，因为《半条命》是一款如此优雅、和谐的游戏。俄罗斯方块是另一个例子。动作游戏来来去去，但俄罗斯方块却经受住了时间的考验，可能会比我们所有人都长寿。

# The Dimensions of a Game World 游戏世界的维度

A game's setting and world are defined by many different variables, each of which describes one dimension of the world, one of the aspects of the game's look and feel. To fully define your world and its setting, you need to consider each of these dimensions and answer certain questions about them.

游戏的背景和世界由许多不同的变量定义，每个变量都描述了世界的一个维度，即游戏外观和感觉的一个方面。要全面定义你的世界及其背景，你需要考虑其中的每一个维度，并回答有关它们的某些问题。

## The Physical Dimension 物理维度

Game settings are almost always implemented as some sort of physical space. The player moves his avatar in and around this space, or moves other pieces, characters, or units in it. The physical characteristics of this space determine a great deal about the gameplay.

游戏设置几乎总是作为某种物理空间来实现的。玩家可以在这个空间中移动自己的化身，也可以在这个空间中移动其他棋子、角色或单位。这个空间的物理特性在很大程度上决定了游戏玩法。

Even text adventures include a physical dimension. The player moves from one abstract “room” or other discrete location to another. Back when more people played text adventures, the boxes used to carry proud boasts about the number of rooms in the game. Gamers could take this as a very rough measure of the size of the world they could explore in the game and, therefore, the amount of gameplay that the game offered.

即使是文字冒险也包含物理维度。玩家从一个抽象的“房间”或其他不相关地点移动到另一个位置。当越来越多的人开始玩文字冒险游戏时，游戏包装盒上会自豪地标注游戏中房间的数量。游戏玩家可以用它粗略衡量他们在游戏中可以探索的世界的大小，从而衡量游戏所提供的游戏性。

The physical dimension of a game is itself characterized by several different elements: dimensionality, scale, and boundaries.

游戏的物理维度本身由几个不同的元素构成：空间维度、规模和边界。

### Dimensionality 空间维度

One of the first questions you have to ask yourself is how many dimensions your physical space is going to have. A few years ago, the vast majority of games had only two dimensions. This was especially noticeable in side-scrolling games such as Super Mario Brothers. Mario could run left and right and jump up and down, but he could not move toward the player (“out” of the screen) or away from him (“into” the screen).

你首先要问自己的一个问题是，你的物理空间将有多少维度。几年前，绝大多数游戏只有两个维度。这在《超级马里奥兄弟》等卷轴游戏中尤为明显。马里奥可以左右奔跑、上下跳跃，但他不能向玩家移动（“离开”屏幕），也不能离开玩家（“进入”屏幕）。

It is essential to understand that the dimensionality of the game's physical space is not the same as how the game will display that space or how it will implement the space in software. Ultimately, all spaces must be displayed on the two-dimensional surface of the monitor screen, but that's a problem for a programmer, not a designer. How to implement and display the space are separate but related questions. The former has to do with technical design, and the latter has to do with user interface design.

我们必须明白，游戏物理空间的维度并不等同于游戏将如何显示该空间或如何在软件中实现该空间。归根结底，所有空间都必须显示在显示器屏幕的二维表面上，但这是程序员的问题，而不是设计师的问题。如何实现和显示空间是两个不同但相关的问题。前者与技术设计有关，后者与用户界面设计有关。

Nowadays, a great many computer game settings have a three-dimensional space, even though the game might implement it in various ways. Starcraft, a war game, shows you plateaus and lowlands, as well as aircraft that pass over obstacles and ground units. Starcraft's setting is clearly three-dimensional, but the space is actually implemented in a series of two-dimensional planes or layers, one above another. Objects can be placed and moved within a plane with a fine degree of precision, but vertically, an object must be in one plane; there is no “in between.” Flying objects can't move up and down in the air; they're always at the same altitude—in the “air layer”.

如今，许多电脑游戏都有三维空间的背景，尽管游戏可能会以不同的方式来实现它。《星际争霸》是一款战争游戏，它向你展示了高原和低地，以及越过障碍物的飞机和地面部队。《星际争霸》的背景显然是三维的，但空间实际上是以一系列二维平面或层叠的方式实现的。物体可以在一个平面内精确地放置和移动，但在垂直方向上，物体必须在一个平面内，没有“中间”。飞行物体无法在空中上下移动，它们始终处于同一高度的“空气层”中。

When first thinking about the dimensionality of your game space, it's tempting to immediately assume that you want it to be three-dimensional because that offers the greatest flexibility or seems more real. But as with everything else, the dimensionality of your physical space must serve the entertainment value of the game. Make sure all the dimensions will contribute meaningfully. Lemmings was a hit 2D game, but Lemmings 3D was nowhere near as successful because it was much more difficult to play. The addition of a third dimension detracted from the player's enjoyment rather than adding to it.

在最初考虑游戏空间的维度时，很容易立即假定游戏空间是三维的，因为三维空间具有最大的灵活性，或者看起来更真实。但与其他任何事情一样，物理空间的维度必须服务于游戏的娱乐价值。确保所有的维度都能做出有意义的贡献。《旅鼠》是一款大受欢迎的 2D 游戏，但《旅鼠 3D》却远没有那么成功，因为它难玩得多。增加第三个维度非但没有增加玩家的乐趣，反而减少了玩家的乐趣。

It's possible to have more than three spatial dimensions, but, in general, we don't recommend it. A computer can display a distorted approximation of four-dimensional space in the two dimensions of the monitor screen, just as it can display an approximation of three-dimensional space in two dimensions. However, because humans are not used to dealing with 4D spaces, most of us have a hard time navigating through them. If you want to include a fourth dimension for some reason, you might consider doing it as an “alternate plane of reality” rather than an actual four-dimensional space. In other words, you have two three-dimensional spaces that look similar, but there is something different about them. For example, the game Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver contained two three-dimensional spaces, the spectral realm and the material realm. The landscape was the same in each, but the spectral realm was lit by a blue light while the material realm was lit by white light; the actions available to the player were different in the spectral real from the material realm. Although they were both implemented in software by the same 3D models, they were functionally different places governed by different laws. In the movie version of The Lord of the Rings, the world that Frodo inhabits while he is wearing the Ring can be thought of as an alternate plane of reality as well, overlapping the real world but appearing and behaving differently.

空间维度可以超过三维，但一般来说，我们不建议这样做。计算机可以在显示器屏幕的二维空间中显示扭曲的四维空间近似物，就像它可以在二维空间中显示三维空间的近似物一样。然而，由于人类不习惯与四维空间打交道，我们中的大多数人都很难在四维空间中游刃有余。如果出于某种原因想要加入四维空间，可以考虑将其作为“现实的另一个位面”，而不是真正的四维空间。换句话说，两个三维空间看起来很相似，但又有一些不同之处。例如，游戏《凯恩的遗产：夺魂之镰》包含两个三维空间：幽灵界和物质界。这两个空间的景观是一样的，但幽灵界的灯光是蓝色的，而物质界的灯光是白色的；玩家在幽灵界和物质界可以采取的行动也是不同的。虽然它们都是通过相同的三维模型在软件中实现的，但它们在功能上是不同的，受不同的法则支配。在电影版《魔戒》中，弗罗多戴着魔戒时所处的世界也可以看作是现实世界的另一个位面，它与现实世界重叠，但在外观和行为上有所不同。

### Scale 规模

By scale, we mean both the total size of the physical space represented and the relative sizes of objects in the game. If a game is purely abstract and doesn't correspond to anything in the real world, the sizes of objects in its game world don't really matter. You can adjust them to suit the game's needs any way you like. But if you are designing a game that is at least somewhat representational of the real world, you'll have to address the question of how big everything should be to both look real and play well. Some distortion is often necessary for the sake of gameplay; the trick is to do it without harming the player's suspension of disbelief too much.

我们所说的规模，既指游戏所表现的物理空间的总大小，也指游戏中物体的相对大小。如果一款游戏纯粹是抽象的，与现实世界中的任何事物都不对应，那么游戏世界中物体的大小其实并不重要。你可以根据游戏的需要随意调整。但是，如果你设计的游戏至少在某种程度上代表了现实世界，那么你就必须解决这样一个问题，即所有东西都应该有多大，才能看起来既真实又好玩。为了保证游戏的可玩性，一定的失真往往是必要的；诀窍在于如何在不损害玩家信任感的前提下做到这一点。

With a sports game, a driving game, a flight simulator, or any other kind of game in which the player will expect a high degree of verisimilitude, you have little choice but to scale things to their actual sizes. In old sports games, it was not uncommon for the athletes to be depicted as 12 feet tall to make them more visible, but nowadays players wouldn't tolerate a game taking such liberties with reality. Serious simulations need an accurate representation of the physical world.

在体育游戏、驾驶游戏、飞行模拟器或其他任何玩家期望高度逼真的游戏中，你别无选择，只能按照实际尺寸缩放物体。在以前的体育游戏中，运动员被描绘成 12 英尺（ 365 厘米）高并不罕见，这样做是为了让他们更显眼，但现在的玩家不会容忍游戏如此脱离现实。严肃的模拟游戏需要准确地再现物理世界。

Similarly, you should scale most of the objects in first-person games accurately. Fortunately, almost all first-person games are set indoors or within very limited areas that are seldom larger than a few hundred feet in any dimension, so this doesn't create implementation problems. Because the player's perspective is that of a person walking through the space, objects need to look right for their surrounding area. You might want to slightly exaggerate the size of critical objects such as keys, weapons, or ammunition to make them more visible, but most things, such as doors and furniture, should be scaled normally. As screen resolutions continue to improve, we'll no longer need to exaggerate objects for visual clarity, unless we want to do so for a comic or cartoonlike effect.

同样，第一人称游戏中的大部分物体都应该精确缩放。幸运的是，几乎所有第一人称游戏的场景都设置在室内或非常有限的区域内，这些区域在任何维度上都很少超过几百英尺，因此这并不会造成实施上的问题。由于玩家的视角是一个人在空间中行走，因此物体需要看起来与周围环境相符。对于钥匙、武器或弹药等关键物品，您可能需要稍微夸大其尺寸，使其更加显眼，但大多数物品（如门和家具）都应按正常比例缩放。随着屏幕分辨率的不断提高，我们将不再需要为了视觉清晰度而夸大物体的尺寸，除非我们想做成漫画或卡通效果。

If you're designing a game with an aerial or isometric perspective, you might need to fudge the scale of things somewhat. The real world is so much larger and more detailed than a game world that it's impossible to represent objects in their true scale in such a perspective. For example, in modern mechanized warfare, ground battles can easily take place over a 20-mile front, with weapons that can fire that far or farther. If you were to map an area this size onto a computer screen, an individual soldier or even a tank would be smaller than a single pixel, completely invisible. Although the player will normally be zoomed in on one small area of the whole map, the scale of objects will have to be somewhat exaggerated so that they're clearly identifiable on the screen.

如果你在设计一款采用空中或等距视角的游戏，你可能需要在比例上做一些调整。现实世界要比游戏世界大得多，也细致得多，在这种视角下不可能表现出物体的真实比例。例如，在现代机械化战争中，地面战很容易发生在 20 英里的战线上，而武器的射程可以达到或超过 20 英里。如果把这么大的区域映射到电脑屏幕上，单个士兵甚至坦克都会比一个像素还小，完全看不到。虽然玩家通常会放大整个地图中的一小块区域，但物体的比例必须有所夸张，以便在屏幕上清晰可辨。

One of the most common distortions games make is in the relative heights of people and the buildings or hills in their environment. The buildings are often only a little taller than the people who walk past them. To be able to see the roofs of all the buildings or the tops of all the hills, the camera must be positioned above the highest point on the ground; but if the camera is too high, the people would hardly be visible at all. To solve this problem, the game simply does not include tall buildings or hills and exaggerates the height of the people. Because the vertical dimension is seldom critical to the gameplay in things such as war games and role-playing games, it doesn't matter if it's not accurate, as long as it's not so inaccurate that it interferes with suspension of disbelief.

游戏中最常见的失真现象之一是人与环境中建筑物或山丘的相对高度。建筑物往往只比走过的人高一点点。要想看到所有建筑物的屋顶或所有山丘的顶端，摄像机的位置必须高于地面的最高点；但如果摄像机的位置太高，人就几乎看不到了。为了解决这个问题，游戏干脆不包含高大的建筑物或山丘，并夸大了人物的高度。因为在战争游戏和角色扮演游戏等游戏中，纵向维度很少对游戏性起关键作用，所以只要不是不精确到影响信任感的程度，纵向维度不精确也没有关系。

Designers often make another scale distortion between indoor and outdoor locations. When a character is walking through a town, simply going from one place to another, the player will want the character to get there reasonably quickly. The scale of the town should be small enough that the character takes only a few minutes to get from one end to another, unless the point of the game is to explore a richly detailed urban environment. When the character steps inside a building, however, and needs to negotiate doors and furniture, you should expand the scale to show these additional details. If you use the same animation for a character walking indoors and outdoors, this will give the impression that the character walks much faster outdoors than indoors. However, this seldom bothers players—they'd much rather have the game proceed quickly than have their avatar take hours to get anywhere, even if that would be more accurate.

设计师经常会在室内和室外地点之间进行另一种缩放失真。当角色在城镇中穿行，只是从一个地方走到另一个地方时，玩家会希望角色能比较快速到达目的地。除非游戏的目的是探索一个细节丰富的城市环境，否则城镇的规模应该足够小，角色从一端走到另一端只需要几分钟的时间。但是，当角色走进一栋建筑，需要与门和家具打交道时，就应该扩大比例，以显示这些额外的细节。如果角色在室内和室外行走时使用相同的动画，会让人觉得角色在室外行走的速度比室内快得多。不过，这很少会让玩家感到困扰————他们更希望游戏能快速进行，而不是让他们的化身走几个小时后到达目的地，即使这样才更准确。

This brings up one final distortion, which is also affected by the game's notion of time (see the section, “The Temporal Dimension”), and that is the relative speeds of moving objects. In the real world, a supersonic jet fighter can fly more than a hundred times faster than an infantry soldier can walk on the ground. If you're designing a game that includes both infantry soldiers and jet fighters, you're going to have a problem. If the scale of the battlefield is suitable for jets, it will take infantry weeks to walk across; if it's suitable for infantry, a jet could pass over it in the blink of an eye. One solution to this is to do what the real military does and implement transport vehicles for ground troops. Another is simply to fudge it and pretend that jets fly only four or five times as fast as people walk. As long as the jet is the fastest thing in the game, it doesn't really matter how much faster it is; the “strike and retreat” tactic that jets are good at will still work. Setting these values is all part of balancing the game, as discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, “Gameplay.”

这就带来了最后一种失真曲，它也受到游戏时间概念的影响（见“时间维度”部分），那就是移动物体的相对速度。在现实世界中，一架超音速喷气式战斗机的飞行速度是一名步兵在地面上行走速度的 100 多倍。如果你要设计一款同时包含步兵和喷气式战斗机的游戏，你就会遇到问题。如果战场的规模适合喷气式战斗机，那么步兵需要花费数周的时间才能走过去；如果战场的规模适合步兵，那么喷气式战斗机眨眼间就能从上面飞过。解决这个问题的办法之一是效仿真正的军队，为地面部队配备运输车辆。另一个办法是干脆弄虚作假，假装喷气式飞机的飞行速度只有人类步行速度的四五倍。只要喷气式飞机是游戏中速度最快的东西，那么快多少并不重要；喷气式飞机擅长的“攻击和撤退”战术仍然有效。设置这些值都是平衡游戏的一部分，第七章“游戏性”中将详细讨论。

### Boundaries 边界

In board games, the edge of the board constitutes the edge of the game world. Because computers have a finite size, the physical dimension of a computer game world must have a finite size also. However, computer games are usually more immersive than board games, and they often try to disguise or explain away the fact that the world is limited, to maintain the player's suspension of disbelief.

在棋盘游戏中，棋盘的边缘就是游戏世界的边缘。因为计算机的尺寸是有限的，所以计算机游戏世界的物理尺寸也必须是有限的。不过，电脑游戏通常比棋盘游戏更能让玩家身临其境，而且电脑游戏通常会试图掩盖或解释世界是有限的这一事实，以保持玩家的信任感。

In some cases, the boundaries of a game world arise naturally, and we don't have to disguise or explain them. Sports games take place only in a stadium or an arena, and no one expects or wants them to include the larger world. In most driving games, the car is restricted to a track or a road, and this, too, is reasonable enough.

在某些情况下，游戏世界的边界是自然形成的，我们无需加以掩饰或解释。体育游戏只在体育馆或竞技场内进行，没有人期望或想要它们包括更大的世界。在大多数驾驶游戏中，汽车只能在赛道或道路上行驶，这也是很合理的。

Setting a game underground or indoors helps to create natural boundaries for the game world. Everyone expects indoor regions to be of a limited size, with walls defining the edges. The problem occurs when games move outdoors, where people expect large, open spaces without sharply defined edges. A common solution in this case is to set the game on an island surrounded by water or by some other kind of impassable terrain: mountains, swamps, or deserts. These establish both a credible and a visually distinctive “edge of the world.”

将游戏设置在地下或室内有助于为游戏世界创造自然的边界。每个人都希望室内区域的大小有限，边缘由墙壁界定。当游戏转移到室外时，问题就出现了，因为人们希望室外有广阔、开阔的空间，而没有清晰界定的边缘。在这种情况下，一种常见的解决方案是将游戏设置在一个四面环水的小岛上，或设置在其他一些无法通行的地形上：高山、沼泽或沙漠。这些地形建立了让人信服和视觉上形成了独特的“世界边缘”。

In flight simulators, the boundaries of the world are even more problematic. Most flight simulators restrict the player to a particular area of the real world. Because there are no walls in the air, there's nothing to stop the plane from flying up to the edge of the game world, and the player can clearly see when he has arrived there that there's nothing beyond. In some games, the plane just stops there, hovering in midair, and won't go any farther. In Battlefield 1942, the game tells the player that he has left the scene of the action and forcibly returns him to the runway.

在飞行模拟器中，世界的边界问题更大。大多数飞行模拟器将玩家限制在真实世界的特定区域内。因为空中没有墙壁，所以没有任何东西可以阻止飞机飞到游戏世界的边缘，而当玩家到达那里时，可以清楚地看到外面什么也没有。在有些游戏中，飞机就停在那里，悬停在半空中，不会再往前飞了。在《战地 1942》中，游戏会告诉玩家他已经离开了行动场地，并强行将他送回跑道。

A common solution to the edge-of-the-world problem is to allow the flat world to “wrap” at the top, bottom, and sides. Although the world is implemented as a rectangular space in the software, objects that cross one edge appear at the opposite edge—they wrap around the world. If the object remains centered on the screen and the world appears to move beneath it, you can create the impression that the world is spherical. This was used to excellent effect in Bullfrog Productions' game Magic Carpet. In another Bullfrog game, Populous: The Beginning, the world was actually displayed graphically as a sphere on the screen, not just a wrapping rectangle.

解决世界边缘问题的常见方法是让平面世界在顶部、底部和侧面“环绕”。尽管软件中的世界是以矩形空间的形式实现的，但越过一条边的物体会出现在对边————它们会环绕世界。如果物体在屏幕上保持居中，而世界在其下方移动，就会给人一种世界是球形的印象。在牛蛙公司的游戏《魔法飞毯》中，这种方法得到了很好的应用。在另一款牛蛙的游戏《上帝也疯狂：开天辟地》中，世界实际上是以球形的图形显示在屏幕上的，而不仅仅是一个包裹的矩形。

### The Temporal Dimension 时间维度

The temporal dimension of a game world defines the way that time is treated in that world and the ways in which it differs from time in the real world.

游戏世界的时间维度定义了在该世界中处理时间的方式，以及时间与现实世界中时间的不同之处。

In many turn-based games and action games, the world doesn't include a concept of time passing, days and nights, or seasons and years. Everything in the world idles or runs in a continuous loop until the player interacts with it in some way. Occasionally, the player is put under pressure by being given a limited amount of real-world time to accomplish something, but this is usually just a single challenge, not part of a larger notion of time in the game.

在许多回合制游戏和动作游戏中，世界并不包含时间流逝、日夜、季节和年份的概念。世界上的一切都在空转或连续循环运行，直到玩家以某种方式与之互动。偶尔，玩家会在现实世界有限的时间内完成某项任务，从而承受压力，但这通常只是一次挑战，而不是游戏中更大时间概念的一部分。

In some games, time is implemented as part of the setting but not part of the gameplay. Here time creates atmosphere and gives the game some variety, but it doesn't change the way you play the game. This usually feels rather artificial. If the player can do exactly the same things at night that she can during the daytime, and no one ever seems to sleep, then there's little point in making the distinction. For time to serve the fantasy, it must affect it in meaningful ways.

在有些游戏中，时间是作为游戏设置的一部分来实现的，但却不是游戏玩法的一部分。在这些游戏中，时间营造了游戏氛围，使游戏变得丰富多彩，但它并不会改变你玩游戏的方式。这通常会给人一种相当矫揉造作的感觉。如果玩家晚上能做的事情和白天完全一样，而且似乎没有人会睡觉，那么区分时间就没有什么意义了。要让时间为幻想服务，它就必须以有意义的方式发挥作用。

Baldur's Gate is a good example of a game in which time is meaningful. Baldur's Gate is a very large role-playing game implemented according to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. At night, shops are closed and the characters in the game run an increased risk of being attacked by wandering monsters. It's also darker and hard to see. Taverns are open all day and all night, which is reasonable enough, but the customers don't ever seem to leave and the bartender never goes off shift. In this way, the game's use of time is a little inconsistent, but the discrepancy serves the gameplay well because you can always trade with the bartender and pick up gossip no matter what time it is. The characters do need rest if they've been on the march for a long while, and this makes them vulnerable while they're sleeping. In the underground portions of the game, day and night have less meaning, as you would expect.

游戏《博德之门》是让时间有意义的一个很好的例子。《博德之门》是一款按照《龙与地下城》高级版规则制作的大型角色扮演游戏。到了晚上，商店都关门了，游戏中的角色被游荡的怪物袭击的风险也增加了。此外，夜色也会更暗，视线也会变得模糊。酒馆整日整夜营业，这很合理，但顾客似乎永远不会离开，酒保也永远不会下班。这样一来，游戏对时间的利用就有点不一致了，但这种不一致却很好地满足了游戏的需求，因为无论什么时候，你都可以与酒保交易，打听小道消息。如果游戏中的角色长时间处于行军状态，他们确实需要休息，这就使得他们在睡觉时很容易受到伤害。在游戏的地下部分，你可能已经猜到了，白天和黑夜的差别并不大。

### Variable Time 可变时间

In games that do implement time as a significant element of the gameplay, as in books and movies, time in the game world usually runs much faster than in reality and often jumps, skipping periods when nothing interesting is happening. Most war games, for example, don't bother to implement nighttime or require that soldiers get any rest. In reality, soldier fatigue is a critical consideration in warfare, but because sleeping soldiers don't make exciting viewing and certainly aren't very interactive, most games just skip it. Allowing soldiers to fight continuously without a pause permits the player to play continuously without a pause also.

在那些将时间作为重要游戏元素的游戏中，就像在书籍和电影中一样，游戏世界中的时间运行得通常比现实中快很多，而且经常是跳跃式的，跳过了没有任何有趣事情发生的时间段。例如，大多数战争游戏都懒得设置夜间时间，也不要求士兵休息。在现实中，士兵的疲劳是战争中的一个重要考虑因素，但由于熟睡的士兵并不令人激动，当然也没有什么互动性，因此大多数游戏都直接跳过这一点。让士兵连续作战而不休息，也就可以让玩家连续游戏而不暂停。

The Sims, a game about people living in a house, handles this problem a different way. The simulated characters require rest and sleep for their health, so The Sims depicts day and night accurately. However, when all the characters go to sleep, the game speeds up considerably, letting hours go by in a few seconds. As soon as anyone wakes up, it slows back down again.

《模拟人生》是一款关于人们在房子里生活的游戏，它以不同的方式处理了这个问题。《模拟人生》中的模拟人物需要休息和睡眠来保持健康，因此《模拟人生》准确地描述了白天和黑夜。不过，当所有角色都进入梦乡时，游戏速度会大大加快，几秒钟就能过去几个小时。一旦有人醒来，游戏速度又会变慢。

The Sims is a rather unusual game in that it's chiefly about time management. You are under constant pressure to have your characters accomplish all their chores and get time for sleep, relaxation, and personal development as well. The game runs at something like 48 times as fast as real life, so you can play through the 16 hours of daytime in about 20 minutes. However, the characters don't move 48 times as fast. Their actions look pretty normal, about like real time. As a result, it takes them 15 minutes on the game's clock just to go out and pick up the newspaper. This contributes to the sense of time pressure. Because the characters do everything slowly (in game terms), they often don't get a chance to water the flowers, which consequently die.

《模拟人生》是一款相当特别的游戏，因为它的主要内容是时间管理。你面临着持续的压力，要让你的角色完成所有的家务，同时也要保证睡眠、放松和个人发展。游戏的运行速度大约是现实生活中的 48 倍，因此你可以在 20 分钟内玩完白天的 16 个小时。不过，人物的移动速度并没有 48 倍快。他们的动作看起来很正常，和现实时间差不多。因此，按游戏时间计算，他们出门取报纸需要 15 分钟。这就造成了时间压力感。由于角色做任何事情都很慢（在游戏中），他们往往没有机会给花浇水，结果花就死了。

### Anomalous Time 反常时间

In The Settlers III, a complex economic simulation, a tree can grow from a sapling to full size in about the same length of time that it takes for an iron foundry to smelt four or five bars of iron. This is a good example of anomalous time: time that seems to move at different speeds in different parts of the game. Blue Byte, the developer of The Settlers, tuned the length of time it takes to do each of the many tasks in the game to make sure that it would run smoothly. As a result, The Settlers is very well balanced at some cost to realism. However, it's doesn't disrupt the fantasy because The Settlers doesn't actually give the player a clock in the game world. There's no way to compare game time to real time, so in effect, the game world has no obvious timescale.

在《工人物语 3》这款复杂的经济模拟游戏中，一棵树从幼苗长成参天大树所需的时间，与一个炼铁厂冶炼四五块铁所需的时间差不多。这就是反常时间的一个很好的例子：在游戏的不同部分，时间似乎以不同的速度运行。《工人物语》的开发商 Blue Byte 调整了游戏中每一项任务所需的时间长度，以确保游戏运行流畅。因此，《工人物语》的平衡性非常好，但也付出了一定的现实感代价。不过，这并没有破坏幻想，因为《工人物语》实际上并没有给玩家提供游戏世界中的时钟。玩家无法将游戏时间与现实时间进行比较，因此实际上游戏世界没有明显的时间刻度。

Another example of anomalous time appears in Age of Empires, in which tasks that should take less than a day in real time (gathering berries from a bush, for example) seem to take years in game time according to the game clock. Age of Empires does have a timescale, visible on the game clock, but not everything in the world makes sense on that timescale. The players simply have to accept these actions as symbolic rather than real. As designers, we have to make them work in the context of the game world without disrupting the fantasy. As long as the symbolic actions (gathering berries or growing trees) don't have to be coordinated with real-time actions (warfare), but remain essentially independent processes, it doesn't matter if they operate on an anomalous time scale.

另一个时间反常的例子出现在《帝国时代》中，根据游戏时钟的显示，在现实时间中理应不到一天就能完成的任务（例如从灌木丛中采集浆果），在游戏时间中似乎要花上好几年。《帝国时代》确实有一个时间刻度，可以在游戏时钟上看到，但并非世界上的所有事情都能在这个时间刻度上合理。玩家只需接受这些行为是象征性的，而不是真实的。作为设计者，我们必须在不破坏幻想的前提下，让它们在游戏世界中发挥作用。只要象征性行动（采集浆果或种植树木）不必与实时行动（战争）协调，而是保持本质上的独立过程，那么它们在异常的时间尺度上运行也没有关系。

### Letting the Player Adjust Time 让玩家调整时间

In sports games and vehicle simulations, game time usually runs at the same speed as real time. An American football game is, by definition, an hour long, but because the clock In sports games and vehicle simulations, game time usually runs at the same speed as real time. An American football game is, by definition, an hour long, but because the clock stops all the time, the actual elapsed time of a football game is closer to three hours. All serious computerized football games simulate this accurately. Verisimilitude is a key requirement of most sports games; if a game does not accurately simulate the real sport, it might not be approved by the league, and its competitors are bound to point it out as a flaw. However, most such games also allow the players to shorten the game by playing 5- or 10-minute quarters instead of 15-minute ones because most people don't want to devote a full three hours to playing a simulated football game. This is also a useful feature in testing; it would take far too long to test the product if you had to play a full-length game every time.

在体育游戏和车辆模拟中，游戏时间通常与真实时间以相同的速度运行。根据定义，美式足球比赛的时间为一小时，但由于在体育游戏和车辆模拟中，游戏时间通常与真实时间以相同的速度运行。根据定义，美式足球比赛的时间为一小时，但由于时钟会一直停止，因此足球比赛的实际时间接近三小时。所有严肃的电脑足球游戏都能准确模拟这一点。真实性是大多数体育游戏的关键要求；如果一款游戏不能准确模拟真实的体育运动，它就可能得不到联盟的批准，其竞争对手也必然会指出它的缺陷。不过，大多数此类游戏还允许玩家缩短比赛时间，将每节比赛的时间从 15 分钟缩短到 5 分钟或 10 分钟，因为大多数人并不想花整整三个小时来玩一场模拟足球比赛。这在测试中也是一个有用的功能；如果每次都要玩一整场比赛，测试产品的时间就太长了。

Flight simulators also usually run in real time. But there are often long periods of flying straight and level during which nothing of interest is going on; the plane is simply traveling from one place to another. To shorten these periods, many games offer a way to “speed up time” by two, four, or eight times—in effect, making everything in the game world go faster than real time. When the plane approaches its destination, the player can return the game to normal speed and play in real time.

飞行模拟器通常也是实时运行的。但是，通常会有很长一段时间是平直飞行的，在此期间不会发生任何有趣的事情；飞机只是从一个地方飞到另一个地方。为了缩短这些时间，许多游戏都提供了一种方法，可以将时间“加速”两倍、四倍或八倍————实际上就是让游戏世界中的一切都比真实时间快。当飞机接近目的地时，玩家可以将游戏速度恢复到正常速度，并进行实时游戏。

## The Environmental Dimension 环境维度

The environmental dimension describes the world's appearance and its atmosphere. We've seen that the physical dimension defines the shape of the game's space; the environmental dimension is about what's in that space. Its two related elements, cultural context and physical surroundings, make up the visual implementation of the game's setting.

环境维度描述的是世界的外观和氛围。我们已经看到，物理维度定义了游戏空间的形状；环境维度则是关于空间中的事物。文化背景和物理环境这两个相关元素构成了游戏环境的视觉表现。

### Cultural Context 文化背景

When we speak of the cultural context of a game, we're talking about culture in the anthropological sense: the beliefs, attitudes, and values that the people in the game world hold, as well as their political and religious institutions, social organization, and so on. These characteristics are reflected in the manufactured items that appear in the game: clothing, furniture, architecture, landscaping, and every other man-made object in the world. The culture influences not only what appears and what doesn't (a game set in a realistic ancient Egypt obviously shouldn't include firearms), but also how everything looks. The appearance of objects is affected not only by their function in the world, but also by the aesthetic sensibilities of the people who constructed them: A Maori shield will look entirely different from King Arthur's shield.

当我们谈论游戏的文化背景时，我们指的是人类学意义上的文化：游戏世界中的人们所持有的信仰、态度和价值观，以及他们的政治和宗教机构、社会组织等等。这些特征反映在游戏中出现的人造物品上：服装、家具、建筑、景观以及世界上的其他所有人造物品。文化不仅会影响游戏中出现的物品和不出现的物品（一款以逼真的古埃及为背景的游戏显然不应该出现枪支），还会影响所有物品的外观。物体的外观不仅受到其在世界中的功能的影响，还受到建造它们的人的审美情趣的影响：毛利人的盾牌与亚瑟王的盾牌看起来完全不同。

The cultural context also includes the game's back story. The back story of a game is the imaginary history, either large-scale (nations, wars, natural disasters) or small-scale (personal events and interactions) that preceded the time when the game takes place. This historical background helps to establish why the culture is the way it is. A warlike people should have a history of warfare; a mercantile people should have a history of trading. In designing this, don't go into too much depth too early, however. As we warned in Chapter 2, “Game Concepts,” the story serves the game, not the other way around.

文化背景还包括游戏的背景故事。游戏的背景故事是游戏发生之前的虚构历史，可以是大范围的历史（国家、战争、自然灾害），也可以是小范围的历史（个人事件和互动）。历史背景有助于确定文化的形成原因。好战的民族应该有战争史，重商的民族应该有贸易史。不过，在设计时不要过早深入。正如我们在[第 二章](chapter-2.md)“游戏概念”中提醒的那样，故事服务于游戏，而不是相反。

For most game worlds, it's not necessary to define their culture in great detail. If the game is set in your own culture, you can simply use the things that you see around you. The Sim City series, for example, is clearly set in present-day America (European cities are rarely so rectilinear), and it looks like it. But when your game begins to deviate from your own culture, you need to start thinking about how it deviates and what consequences that has.

对于大多数游戏世界，没有必要详细定义其文化。如果游戏的背景是你自己的文化，你只需使用你周围的事物即可。例如，《模拟城市》系列显然是以当今的美国为背景（欧洲城市很少是直线型的），而且看起来也是如此。但是，当你的游戏开始偏离你自己的文化时，你就需要开始考虑它是如何偏离的以及会产生什么后果。

### Physical Surroundings 物理环境

The physical surroundings define what the game actually looks like. This is the part of game design in which it's most helpful to be an artist or to work closely with one. In the early stages of design, you don't need to make drawings of every single thing that can appear in the game world, although sooner or later someone is going to have to. But for the time being, it's important to create concept sketches: pencil or pen-and-ink drawings of key visual elements in the game. Depending on what your game is about, this can include buildings, vehicles, clothing, weaponry, furniture, decorations, works of art, jewelry, religious or magical items, logos or emblems, and on and on. Man-made items in particular are influenced by the game's culture. A powerful and highly religious people are likely to have large symbols of their spirituality: stone temples or cathedrals. A warlike nomadic people will have animals or vehicles to carry their gear and weapons suitable for use on the move. (Note that these might be future nomads, driving dune buggies rather than camels.)

物理环境决定了游戏的实际外观。在游戏设计的这一部分，如果你是一名美术师，或者能与美术师密切合作，将对你的工作大有帮助。在设计的早期阶段，你不需要为游戏世界中可能出现的每一样东西都画图纸，尽管迟早会有人这样做。但目前最重要的是绘制概念草图：用铅笔或水墨画出游戏中的关键视觉元素。根据游戏的内容，这些元素可以包括建筑、车辆、服装、武器、家具、装饰品、艺术品、珠宝、宗教或魔法物品、标志或徽章等等。人造物品尤其会受到游戏文化的影响。一个强大而虔诚的民族很可能拥有大型的精神象征：石制寺庙或大教堂。好战的游牧民族则会有动物或车辆来携带适合移动使用的装备和武器。(注意，这些可能是未来的游牧民族，他们驾驶的是沙丘越野车而不是骆驼）。

Nor should you neglect the natural world. Too many games set in urban or indoor environments consisting entirely of man-made things feel sterile, artificially clean, and devoid of life. Think about birds and animals, plants and trees, earth, rocks, hills, and even the sky. Consider the climate: Is it hot or cold, wet or dry? Is the land fertile or barren, flat or mountainous? These things are all parts of a real place, opportunities to create a visually rich and distinctive environment.

你也不应忽视自然世界。有太多的游戏设定在城市或室内环境中，完全由人造物品组成，给人一种无菌、人工清洁、缺乏生命力的感觉。想想鸟兽、草木、泥土、岩石、山丘，甚至天空。想想气候：是炎热还是寒冷，潮湿还是干燥？土地是肥沃还是贫瘠，是平坦还是多山？这些都是真实环境的组成部分，也是创造丰富而独特的视觉环境的机会。

If your world is chiefly indoors, of course, you don't have to think about nature much unless your character passes a window, but there are a hundred other issues instead. Where does the light come from? What are the walls, floors, and ceilings made of, and how are they decorated? Why is this building here? Do the rooms have a specific purpose, and if so, what? How can you tell the purpose of a room from its contents? Does the building have multiple stories? How does the player get from one story to another?

当然，如果你的世界主要是在室内，那么除非你的角色经过窗户，否则你不必过多地考虑自然问题，但除此之外，还有数以百计的其他问题。光线从哪里来？墙壁、地板和天花板是由什么材料制成的？这座建筑为什么会在这里？房间是否有特定用途，如果有，是什么？如何从房间内的物品看出房间的用途？这座建筑有多层吗？玩家如何从一层到达另一层？

Physical surroundings include sounds as well as sights: music, ambient environmental sounds, the particular noises made by people, animals, machinery, and vehicles. Think about the sounds things make at the same time that you think about how they look. This will help you to create a coherent world. Suppose you're inventing a six-legged reptilian saddle animal with clawed feet rather than hooves. How does that sound as it moves? Its scales might rattle a bit. Its feet are not going to make the characteristic clop-clop sound of a shod horse. With six legs, it will probably have some rather odd gaits, and those should be reflected in the sound it makes.

物理环境包括声音和视觉：音乐、环境音、人、动物、机器和车辆发出的特殊声音。在考虑事物外观的同时，也要考虑它们发出的声音。这将有助于你创造一个连贯的世界。假设你发明了一种六条腿的爬行乘骑动物，它有爪子而不是蹄子。它在移动时会发出什么声音？它的鳞片可能会发出一些响声。它的脚不会发出有蹄马特有的“咔嗒咔嗒”声。它有六条腿，可能会有一些比较奇怪的步态，这些都应该反映在它发出的声音中。

The physical surroundings are primarily responsible for setting the tone and mood of the game as it is played, whether it's the lighthearted cheerfulness of Mario or the dimly lit suspense of Thief: The Dark Project. The sound, and especially the music, will contribute greatly to this. Think hard about the kind of music you want, and consider what genres will be appropriate. Stanley Kubrick listened to hundreds of records to select the music for 2001: A Space Odyssey, and he astonished the world with his choice of “The Blue Danube” for the shuttle docking sequence. You have a similar opportunity in designing your game.

无论是《马里奥》的轻松欢快，还是《神偷：黑暗计划》的昏暗悬疑，游戏中的物理环境都主要负责为游戏定下基调和情绪。音效，尤其是音乐，将为此做出巨大贡献。请认真思考您想要什么样的音乐，并考虑适合哪些类型。斯坦利·库布里克在为《2001：太空漫游》挑选音乐时听了数百张唱片，他为穿梭机对接程序选择的“蓝色多瑙河”让全世界为之震惊。在设计游戏时，你也有类似的机会。

### Detail 细节

Every designer must decide how much detail the game world needs—that is to say, how richly textured the world will be and how accurately modeled its behavior will be. This is partly a question of “realism.” Technical limitations and time constraints almost always determine a game's level of detail. No football game goes to the extent of modeling each fan in the stadium, and few flight simulators model all the physical characteristics of their aircraft. Detail helps to support the fantasy, but it always costs, in development time and memory or in disk space on the player's machine. In an adventure game, it should, in principle, be possible to pick up everything in the world; in practice, this just isn't practical. The consequence of this is that the player knows that if an object can be picked up, it must be important for some reason; if it can't be picked up, it isn't important. Similarly, in god games, it's common for all the people to look alike; they're often male adults. Bullfrog Productions once designed a god game with both male and female adults, but there wasn't enough time for the artists to model children as well. People simply had to be “born” into the world full grown. Lionhead's Black and White, on the other hand, managed to include men, women, and children.

每个设计师都必须决定游戏世界需要多少细节，也就是说，游戏世界的纹理要多丰富，游戏行为的建模要多精确。这在一定程度上是一个“现实主义”问题。技术水平和时间限制几乎总是决定了游戏的细节水平。没有一款足球游戏会对体育场内的每个球迷进行建模，也很少有飞行模拟器会对飞机的所有物理特性进行建模。细节有助于支撑幻想，但它总是要付出代价的，包括开发时间、内存或玩家机器上的磁盘空间。在探险游戏中，原则上应该可以拾取世界上的一切，但实际上这并不现实。这样做的结果是，玩家知道，如果一个物体可以被拾起，那么它一定是重要的；如果它不能被拾起，那么它就不重要。同样，在上帝游戏中，所有的人都长得很像，他们通常都是成年男性。牛蛙公司曾经设计过一款有男性和女性成年人的上帝游戏，但没有足够的时间让美工人员制作儿童模型。人们只能以成人的形态“出生”到这个世界上。而狮头公司的《黑与白》则包含了男性、女性和儿童。

Here's a good rule of thumb for determining the level of detail your game will contain: Include as much detail as you can to help the game's immersiveness, up to the point at which it begins to harm the gameplay. If the player is struggling to look after everything you've given him, the game probably has too much detail. (This is one of the reasons war games tend to have hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands of units. The player in a war game can't delegate tasks to intelligent subordinates, so the numbers have to be kept down to a size that he can reasonably manage.) A spectacularly detailed game that's no fun to play won't sell many copies.

在确定游戏的细节水平时，这里有一个很好的经验法则：为了让游戏更有沉浸感，尽可能多地加入细节，直到细节开始损害游戏性为止。如果玩家很难照顾好你给他的一切，那么游戏的细节可能就太多了（这也是战争游戏往往有几百个而不是几十万个单位的原因之一。战争游戏中的玩家无法将任务分配给聪明的下属，因此必须将数量控制在他可以合理管理的范围内）。如果一款游戏的细节做得非常出色，但玩起来却毫无乐趣可言，那么这款游戏的销量也不会太高。

### Defining a Style 定义风格

In describing how your world is going to look, you are defining a visual style for your game that will influence a great many other things as well: the character design, the user interface, perhaps the manual, and even the design of the box and the advertising. You actually have two tasks to take on here: defining the style of things in your world, and also defining the style of the artwork that will depict your world. They aren't the same. For example, you can describe a world whose architectural style is inspired by Southwestern pueblos, but draw it to look like a Warner Brothers cartoon. Or you could have medieval towns with half-timbered houses, but painted in a slightly fuzzy, Impressionistic style. You must choose both your content and the way in which you will present it.

在描述游戏世界的外观时，您正在为游戏定义一种视觉风格，这种风格还将影响其他许多方面：角色设计、用户界面、手册，甚至包装盒和广告的设计。在这里，您实际上要承担两项任务：确定您世界中事物的风格，以及确定描绘您世界的艺术作品的风格。它们并不相同。例如，你可以描述一个建筑风格受西南部村落启发的世界，但要把它画得像华纳兄弟的卡通片。或者，您可以描绘中世纪城镇的半木结构房屋，但却画成略显模糊的印象派风格。您必须选择内容和表现方式。

Both decisions will significantly influence the player's experience of the game, jointly creating a distinct atmosphere. In general, the style of depiction tends to superimpose its mood on the style of the object depicted. For example, a Greek temple might be architecturally elegant, but if its style of drawing suggests a Looney Tunes cartoon, everyone will expect something wacky and outrageous to take place there. The drawing style imposes its own atmosphere over the temple, no matter how majestic it is.

这两个决定都会极大地影响玩家的游戏体验，共同营造出一种独特的氛围。一般来说，描绘风格往往会将其氛围叠加到所描绘对象的风格上。例如，一座希腊神庙的建筑风格可能很优雅，但如果它的绘画风格让人联想到《Looney Tunes》动画片，那么每个人都会以为那里会发生什么古怪离奇的事情。无论神庙多么雄伟壮观，绘画风格都会将自己的氛围强加于神庙之上。

Unless you're the lead artist for your game as well as its designer, you probably shouldn't—or won't be allowed to—do this alone. Your art team will have ideas of its own, and you should listen to those suggestions. The marketing department might insist on having a say as well. It's important, however, that you try to keep the style harmonious and consistent throughout your game. Too many games have been published in which different sections had wildly differing art styles because no one held and enforced a single overall vision.

除非你是游戏的首席美术师兼设计师，否则你可能不应该--或者说不会被允许--独自完成这项工作。你的美术团队会有自己的想法，你应该听取他们的建议。市场营销部门也可能坚持要有发言权。但重要的是，你要尽量保持整个游戏风格的和谐一致。有太多的游戏在发布时，由于没有人坚持和执行统一的整体构想，导致不同部分的艺术风格大相径庭。

### Overused Settings 过度使用的设置

All too often, games borrow settings from one another or from common settings found in the movies and television. A huge number of games are set in science fiction and fantasy worlds, especially the quasimedieval, sword-and-sorcery fantasy inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien and Dungeons & Dragons, popular with the young people who used to be the primary—indeed, almost the only—market for computer games. But a lot more people play games nowadays, and they want new worlds to play in. You should look beyond these hoary old staples of gaming. As we mentioned in Chapter 2, Interstate '76 was inspired by 1970s TV shows. It included cars, clothing, and music from that era, all highly distinctive and evocative of a particular culture. Interstate '76 had great gameplay, but what really set it apart from its competitors was that it looked like nothing else on the market.

很多时候，游戏都会互相借用设定，或者借用电影和电视中的常见设定。大量的游戏都以科幻小说和奇幻世界为背景，尤其是受 J.R.R. 托尔金和龙与地下城启发的准中世纪剑与魔法奇幻世界，深受年轻人的喜爱，他们曾经是电脑游戏的主要市场，甚至几乎是唯一的市场。但现在玩游戏的人越来越多，他们需要新的游戏世界。你应该把眼光放远，不要局限于这些老掉牙的游戏。正如我们在第 2 章中提到的，《76 号州际公路》的灵感来自 20 世纪 70 年代的电视节目。它包含了那个时代的汽车、服装和音乐，所有这些都极具特色，让人联想到特定的文化。州际 76》拥有出色的游戏性，但真正让它从竞争对手中脱颖而出的是，它的外观与市场上其他游戏别无二致。

Especially if you are going to do science fiction or fantasy, try to make it distinctively different. At present, real spacecraft built by the United States or Russia look extremely functional, just as the first cars did in the 1880s, and the spacecraft in computer games tend to look that way also. But as cars became more common, they began exhibiting stylistic variation to appeal to different kinds of people, and now there is a whole school of aesthetics for automotive design. As spacecraft become more common, and especially as we start to see “personal” spacecraft, we should expect them to exhibit stylistic variation as well. This is an area in which you have tremendous freedom to innovate.

尤其是在制作科幻小说或奇幻作品时，应尽量使其与众不同。目前，美国或俄罗斯制造的真实航天器看起来非常实用，就像 19 世纪 80 年代的第一辆汽车一样，电脑游戏中的航天器也往往是这样。但是，随着汽车越来越常见，它们开始展现出风格上的变化，以吸引不同类型的人，现在汽车设计有一整套美学流派。随着航天器越来越常见，特别是当我们开始看到 "个人 "航天器时，我们应该期待它们也会呈现出风格上的变化。在这个领域，你有极大的创新自由。

The same goes for fantasy. Forget the same old elves, dwarves, wizards, and dragons. Look to other cultures for your heroes and villains. Right now about the only non-Western culture portrayed with any frequency in games is Japanese (feudal, present-day, and future) because there is a large market for games in Japan, and Japanese style has found some acceptance in the West as well. But there are many more sources of inspiration around the world, most untapped. Around 1200 A.D., while the rulers of Europe were still holed up in cramped, drafty castles, Islamic culture reached a pinnacle of grace and elegance. Muslims built magnificent palaces filled with the riches of the Orient and majestic mosques of inlaid stone. Yet this proud and beautiful civilization seldom appears in computer games because Western game designers haven't bothered to learn about it or don't even know it existed. Set your fantasy in Valhalla, in Russia under Peter the Great, in the arctic tundra, at Angkor Wat, at Easter Island, or at Machu Picchu.

幻想也是如此。忘掉千篇一律的精灵、矮人、巫师和龙吧。从其他文化中寻找你的英雄和恶棍。目前，游戏中唯一经常描绘的非西方文化是日本文化（封建文化、现代文化和未来文化），因为日本有很大的游戏市场，而且日本风格在西方也有一定的接受度。但是，世界各地还有更多的灵感来源，其中大部分尚未开发。公元 1200 年左右，当欧洲的统治者还窝在狭窄、通风的城堡里时，伊斯兰文化已经达到了优雅和高贵的顶峰。穆斯林建造了富丽堂皇的宫殿，宫殿里堆满了东方的财富，清真寺也是用石头镶嵌而成。然而，这一引以为豪的美丽文明却很少出现在电脑游戏中，因为西方的游戏设计师们不屑于了解它，甚至不知道它的存在。将您的幻想设定在瓦尔哈拉、彼得大帝统治下的俄罗斯、北极苔原、吴哥窟、复活节岛或马丘比丘。

Art and architecture, history and anthropology, literature and religion, clothing fashions, and product design are all great sources of cultural material. Artistic and architectural movements, in particular, offer tremendous riches: Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Palladian, Brutalism. If you haven't heard of one of these, go look it up now. Browse the web or the art, architecture, and design sections of the bookstore or the public library for pictures of interesting objects, buildings, and clothing. Photocopy things that attract your eye and post them around your workspace to inspire yourself and your coworkers. Collect “graphic scrap” from anywhere that you find it. Try old copies of National Geographic. Visit museums of art, design, and natural history if you can get to them; one of the greatest resources of all is travel, if you can afford it. A good game designer is always on the lookout for new ideas, even when he's ostensibly “on vacation.”

艺术和建筑、历史和人类学、文学和宗教、服装时尚和产品设计都是文化资料的重要来源。艺术和建筑运动尤其提供了巨大的财富：新艺术运动、装饰艺术运动、帕拉第奥运动、野蛮主义运动。如果你还没听说过其中的某一个，现在就去查查吧。浏览网络、书店或公共图书馆的艺术、建筑和设计专区，寻找有趣的物品、建筑和服装图片。把吸引你眼球的东西复印下来，张贴在工作区周围，给自己和同事带来灵感。从任何地方收集 "图形废料"。试试旧版的《国家地理杂志》。如果有条件的话，参观艺术、设计和自然历史博物馆；最重要的资源之一就是旅行，如果你有能力的话。一个优秀的游戏设计师总是在寻找新的创意，即使他表面上是在 "度假"。

It's tempting to borrow from our closest visual neighbor, the movies, because in the movies someone has already done the visual design work for us. Blade Runner introduced the decaying urban future; Alien gave us disgustingly biological aliens rather than “little green men.” The problem with these looks is that they've already been borrowed from many, many times. You can use them as a quick-and-dirty backdrop if you don't want to put much effort into developing your world, and players will instantly recognize them and know what they're about. But to stand out from the crowd, consider other genres. Film noir, the Marx Brothers, John Wayne westerns, war movies from the World War II era, costume dramas of all periods... From the silliness of One Million Years B.C. to the Victorian elegance of Wilde, they're all grist for the mill.

从我们的视觉近邻--电影中借鉴是很有诱惑力的，因为在电影中，已经有人为我们完成了视觉设计工作。《银翼杀手》引入了衰败的城市未来；《异形》让我们看到了令人作呕的生物外星人，而不是“小绿人”。这些造型的问题在于，它们已经被借鉴了很多很多次。如果你不想花太多精力来发展你的世界，你可以把它们作为一个速成的背景，玩家会立刻认出它们，并知道它们是关于什么的。但要想在众多类型中脱颖而出，可以考虑其他类型。黑色电影、马克思兄弟、约翰-韦恩西部片、二战时期的战争片、各时期的古装剧……从《公元前一百万年》的傻气到王尔德的维多利亚时代的优雅，它们都是电影的素材。

Television goes through its own distinct phases, and because it's even more fashion-driven than the movies, it is ripe for parody. The comedies of the 1950s and 1960s and the nighttime soaps of the 1970s and 1980s all had characteristic looks that seem laughable today but that are immediately familiar to most adult Americans. That is one potential problem, however: If you make explicit references to American popular culture, non-Americans and children might not get it. If your gameplay is good enough, though, it won't matter.

电视也经历着自己独特的阶段，由于它比电影更受时尚的驱动，因此模仿的时机已经成熟。上世纪五六十年代的喜剧片和七八十年代的夜间肥皂剧都有自己的特色造型，这些造型在今天看来令人啼笑皆非，但对于大多数成年美国人来说却是再熟悉不过了。不过，这也是一个潜在的问题：如果你明确引用美国流行文化，非美国人和儿童可能会不理解。不过，如果你的游戏做得足够好，这并不重要。
