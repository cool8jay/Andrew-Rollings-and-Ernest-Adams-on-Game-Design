# Chapter 3. Game Settings and Worlds 第三章：游戏场景与世界

A game world is an artificial universe, an imaginary place whose creation begins with the (usually unspoken) words “Let's pretend….” Every game, no matter how small, takes place in a world. Most games have a physical, or at least a visible, manifestation of this world: a set of cards, a board, or an image on a computer screen. Even tic-tac-toe, one of the simplest games imaginable, has a world—a little diagram governed by rules and a victory condition. The boundaries of the diagram are the boundaries of the world. Any marks that you make outside of them are not part of the game.

游戏世界是一个人造的宇宙，是一个想象中的地方，它的创造始于“让我们假装……”（通常是不经意的）一句话。每款游戏，无论多小，都发生在一个世界里。大多数游戏都有一个物理世界，或者至少是一个可见的世界：一套牌、一个棋盘，或者电脑屏幕上的一个图像。即使是井字棋这种可以想象到的最简单的游戏也有一个世界——一个由规则和胜利条件支配的小图。图的边界就是世界的边界。你在图外所做的任何标记都不是游戏的一部分。

The football field defines the physical boundaries of the football game's world. The football game's world is also bounded by time: It has a beginning and an end. When the clock runs out, the world ceases to exist; the game is over. The game can also be interrupted; during a timeout, the world freezes. It still exists in the minds of the players and the spectators—the game is still in progress—but no change can take place within the world until the timeout is over.

足球场定义了足球游戏世界的物理边界。足球游戏的世界也以时间为边界：它有开始和结束。当时间耗尽时，世界就不复存在，比赛也就结束了。比赛也会中断；在暂停期间，世界会冻结。它仍然存在于球员和观众的脑海中——比赛仍在进行，但在暂停结束之前，世界不会发生任何变化。

Not all game worlds have a visible component. The game Twenty Questions consists only of some basic rules and a victory condition, but it still has a world and the world has boundaries. If you're playing Twenty Questions and the questioner asks, “Wanna go surfing after work?,” most people would say that the question lies outside the game world. It doesn't count as one of the 20 allowed. A text adventure is another game defined by words; the world is created in the player's imagination when he reads the text on the screen. A few master chess players can play in their heads, with no board at all—another example of a game world with no physical component.

并非所有游戏世界都有可见的组成部分。游戏《二十个问题》只有一些基本规则和一个胜利条件，但它仍然有一个世界，而这个世界是有边界的。如果你在玩“二十个问题”游戏，提问者问：“下班后想去冲浪吗？”，大多数人会说这个问题不属于游戏世界。它不算是 20 个问题中的一个。文字冒险游戏是另一种由文字定义的游戏；当玩家阅读屏幕上的文字时，世界就在玩家的想象中产生了。一些国际象棋大师可以在脑中下棋，根本不需要棋盘——这也是游戏世界没有物理组成部分的另一个例子。

The setting of a game is its fictional component, that aspect of the game that is a fantasy. Tic-tac-toe has no setting, nor does Twenty Questions; when you play them, you're not pretending to be anywhere else or to do anything besides what you're doing. Chess has just a scrap of a setting; although the board and the moves are abstract, the pieces have names that suggest a medieval court with its king and queen, knights and bishops. Stratego has even more of a setting. The pieces in Stratego are numbered, and you could play the game completely abstractly—my number 5 takes your number 6, and so on—but Milton Bradley has chosen to paint little pictures on them, encouraging us to pretend that they are colonels and sergeants and scouts in an army.

游戏的背景是其虚构的组成部分，是游戏的幻想部分。井字棋没有背景，《二十个问题》也没有；当你玩这些游戏时，你并没有假装在其他任何地方，也没有做任何你正在做的事情以外的事情。国际象棋只有一点点背景；虽然棋盘和走法都很抽象，但棋子的名字却让人联想到中世纪宫廷里的国王和王后、骑士和主教。西洋陆军棋的背景则更加丰富。西洋陆军棋中的棋子是有编号的，你可以完全抽象地玩这个游戏——我的 5 号吃掉你的 6 号，以此类推——但米尔顿·布拉德利选择在棋子上画上小图画，鼓励我们假装它们是军队中的上校、军士和侦察兵。

# The Purpose of a Game Setting 游戏设置的目的

Games exist to entertain, and the entertainment value of a game is derived from several sources: its gameplay, its story, social interaction (if it is a multi-player game), and so on. The setting also contributes to the entertainment that the game provides. In a game such as chess, almost all the entertainment value is in the gameplay; few people think of it as a game about medieval warfare. In an adventure game such as Escape from Monkey Island, the setting is essential to the fantasy. Without the setting, Escape from Monkey Island would not exist, and if it had a different setting, it would be a different game.

游戏是为了娱乐而存在的，而游戏的娱乐价值来自多个方面：游戏玩法、故事情节、社交互动（如果是多人游戏）等等。游戏环境也有助于提高游戏的娱乐性。在国际象棋这样的游戏中，几乎所有的娱乐价值都体现在游戏性上；很少有人会认为这是一款关于中世纪战争的游戏。而在《逃离猴岛》这样的冒险游戏中，环境对于奇幻游戏来说至关重要。没有背景，《逃离猴岛》就不存在，而如果有不同的背景，它就会是另一款游戏。

As a general rule, the more a game depends on its core mechanics to entertain, the less its setting matters. Mastering the core mechanics requires a kind of abstract thought, and fantasy can be a distraction. Serious chess players aren't interested in the shape of the chessmen; their shapes don't contribute significantly to the game. A serious chess player can have just as much fun with a $2 plastic travel chess set as with a $200 inlaid wooden board and solid pewter statues for pieces. As players learn to understand the core mechanics of other games, they stop thinking about the fantasy element as well. When players become highly skilled at a game such as Quake III, they no longer think about the fact that they're pretending to be space marines in a futuristic environment; they think only about hiding, moving, shooting, ambushing, obtaining more ammunition, and so on.

一般来说，游戏的娱乐性越依赖于其核心机制，其背景就越不重要。掌握核心机制需要一种抽象思维，而幻想会分散注意力。严肃的棋手对棋子的形状并不感兴趣，因为它们的形状对游戏的贡献并不大。一个严肃的棋手可以用一套 2 美元的塑料旅行棋，也可以用一套 200 美元的镶嵌木质棋盘和实心锡制雕像棋子，获得同样多的乐趣。当玩家学会理解其他游戏的核心机制时，他们也就不再考虑幻想元素了。当玩家熟练掌握《雷神之锤3》等游戏时，他们就不会再考虑自己是在未来环境中扮演太空陆战队员这一事实；他们只会考虑躲藏、移动、射击、伏击、获取更多弹药等等。

This process of abstraction—ignoring the game's setting—occurs only at a high level of play, however. To someone who's playing a game for the first time, the setting is vital to creating and sustaining his interest. One of the essential functions of a game's setting is actually to sell the game in the first place. It's not the game's mechanics that make a customer pick up a box in a store, but the fantasy it offers: who you'll be, where you'll be, and what you'll be doing there if you play that game.

然而，这种抽象化过程——忽视游戏背景——只有在高水平的游戏中才会出现。对于第一次玩游戏的人来说，游戏的背景对于激发和维持他的兴趣至关重要。实际上，游戏背景的基本功能之一首先是推销游戏。让顾客在商店里拿起一盒游戏的不是游戏的机制，而是它提供的幻想：如果你玩了这款游戏，你会成为谁，你会在哪里，你会在那里做什么。

## The “Graphics Versus Gameplay” Debate “图形与游戏性”之争

The relationship between the setting and the mechanics is the subject of considerable debate in the game industry, although it's usually characterized as “graphics versus gameplay.” The graphics create the setting; the core mechanics, along with the user interface, create the gameplay—the challenges the player faces and the actions he may take to overcome them. In the early days of video gaming, graphics were seriously restricted by the weakness of the display hardware. The gameplay, as implemented by the programmers, was the source of most of the game's appeal. With the growth of modern display technology, the graphics have taken on much greater importance, and creating them consumes a large proportion of a game's development budget. Some designers and programmers, especially those who've been around since the early days, have become rather annoyed at the dominant role that graphics now play. They insist that graphics must be subordinate to gameplay in game design, and as proof they point to examples of games with great graphics and very little gameplay that offer poor value for the money.

在游戏行业中，背景与机制之间的关系一直是争论不休的话题，不过这种争论通常被称为“图形与游戏性”之争。图形创造了环境，而核心机制和用户界面则创造了游戏性——玩家面临的挑战和克服挑战的行动。在早期的视频游戏中，图形受到显示硬件薄弱的严重限制。由程序员实现的游戏性才是游戏吸引力的源泉。随着现代显示技术的发展，图形的重要性大大提高，制作图形耗费了游戏开发预算的很大一部分。一些设计师和程序员，尤其是那些早期的设计师和程序员，对图形现在所起的主导作用感到非常恼火。他们坚持认为，在游戏设计中，图形必须从属于游戏性，并举出一些游戏例子，它们具有出色的图形效果，但游戏性却很低，性价比很低。

This was a serious problem in the early 1990s, when Hollywood studios thought they could take over the game industry because they were better able to create impressive graphics than the game publishers. However, they failed. Hollywood didn't understand software engineering, didn't understand interactivity, and, most important, didn't understand gameplay. The public refused to accept games with bad gameplay, no matter how spectacular the graphics were. After a few false starts, Hollywood learned to work with game publishers rather than trying to become game publishers, realizing that the two groups bring complementary skills to creating games.

这在 20 世纪 90 年代初是一个严重的问题，当时好莱坞工作室认为他们可以接管游戏产业，因为他们比游戏发行商更有能力制作出令人印象深刻的画面。然而，他们失败了。好莱坞不懂软件工程，不懂互动性，最重要的是不懂游戏性。公众拒绝接受游戏性差的游戏，无论其画面多么精彩。在经历了几次失败之后，好莱坞学会了与游戏发行商合作，而不是试图成为游戏发行商，因为他们意识到，这两个群体在创造游戏方面的技能是互补的。

We believe the "graphics versus gameplay" debate is no longer a meaningful one. The truth is that graphics and gameplay must work together to produce the total play experience. The graphics create the setting, which both sells the game and involves the player in the game's fantasy. The gameplay provides the challenge and things for the player to do. Both are essential to the player's enjoyment of the game. The graphics bring in the player, and the gameplay keeps him there.

我们认为，“图形与游戏性”的争论已不再有意义。事实是，画面和游戏性必须相互配合，才能产生全面的游戏体验。画面创造了环境，既推销了游戏，又让玩家参与到游戏的幻想中。游戏玩法则为玩家提供了挑战和活动。两者对于玩家享受游戏都至关重要。画面吸引玩家，而游戏玩法则让玩家留在游戏中。

## Immersiveness and Suspension of Disbelief 沉浸感和悬念

A key part of the experience of reading a novel or watching a movie is suspension of disbelief. Suspension of disbelief is a mental state in which you choose, for a period of time, to believe that this pack of lies, this fiction, is reality. This applies to games as well. When you go inside the game world and temporarily make it your reality, you suspend your disbelief. The better a game supports the illusion, the more thoroughly engrossed you become, and then the more immersive we say the game is. Immersiveness is one of the holy grails of game design.

阅读小说或观看电影的一个重要体验就是终止怀疑。终止怀疑是一种心理状态，在这种状态下，你会在一段时间内选择相信这一切谎言、虚构是真实的。这也适用于游戏。当你进入游戏世界，并暂时把它当作现实时，你就暂缓了你的怀疑。游戏对这种幻觉的支持越好，你就会越彻底地沉迷其中，然后我们就会说这款游戏沉浸感越强。沉浸感是游戏设计的圣杯之一。

Movies and novels try to create the impression that what they depict is real, though fantasy and science fiction novels rather test our patience in this regard. Few movies and novels specifically allude to the fact that they are fiction; they try to preserve the suspension of disbelief. Some deliberately play with the idea. Both the book and the movie The French Lieutenant's Woman specifically alluded to the fact that they were works of fiction, wrenching the audience out of the work's Victorian setting to encourage comparisons with today's world. The movie The Stunt Man similarly kept the viewer—and the movie's hero—off balance, unable to tell whether what we were seeing was supposed to be reality or merely a movie being filmed.

电影和小说试图给人一种印象，即它们所描绘的都是真实的，尽管奇幻和科幻小说在这方面相当考验我们的耐心。很少有电影和小说明确暗示它们是虚构的；它们试图保持终止怀疑。有些电影和小说则故意玩弄这一概念。小说和电影《法国中尉的女人》和电影都特别暗示了它们是虚构作品的事实，将观众从作品的维多利亚时代背景中拉出来，鼓励他们与当今世界进行比较。电影《特技演员》同样让观众和电影主人公失去平衡，分不清我们看到的是现实还是正在拍摄中的电影。

More often, however, suspension of disbelief is broken by poor design. This might occur if one of the people in the story does something that is wildly out of character, or if something highly improbable happens—a deus ex machina—and we are expected to accept it as normal. Another thing that frequently destroys a player's suspension of disbelief or prevents it from ever forming is a lack of harmony, which we discuss next.

然而，更常见的情况是，终止怀疑被拙劣的设计所打破。如果故事中的某个人做出了与角色大相径庭的事情，或者发生了非常不可能发生的事情——一个天神显灵——而我们却要把它当作正常的事情来接受，就会出现这种情况。另一个经常破坏玩家终止怀疑或者阻碍其形成的原因是缺乏和谐，我们将在下文中讨论。

> 译者注：deus ex machina，一种意想不到的力量或事件拯救了看似绝望的局面，尤其是作为戏剧或小说中人为的情节技巧。比如，角色从悬崖跳下去，但被一阵风吹到树上而幸存。

## The Importance of Harmony 和谐的重要性

Good games and game worlds possess harmony, a quality first identified by the legendary game designer Brian Moriarty. Harmony is the feeling that all parts of the game belong to a single, coherent whole. In his lecture “Listen: The Potential of Shared Hallucinations,” Moriarty explained the concept of harmony so well that, with his permission, we use his own words to describe it:

优秀的游戏和游戏世界具有和谐性，这是传奇游戏设计师布莱恩·莫里亚蒂最先发现的一种品质。和谐是一种感觉，即游戏的所有部分都属于一个统一的整体。布莱恩·莫里亚蒂在他的演讲《倾听：共享幻觉的潜力》中，对和谐的概念做了很好的诠释，经他同意，我们用他自己的话来描述和谐：

Harmony isn't something you can fake. You don't need anyone to tell you if it's there or not. Nobody can sell it to you, it's not an intellectual exercise. It's a sensual, intuitive experience. It's something you feel. How do you achieve that feeling that everything works together? Where do you get this harmony stuff?

和谐不能伪造。你不需要任何人告诉你它是否存在。没有人可以向你推销它，它不是一种智力练习。它是一种感性的、直观的体验。这是你的感觉。你是如何实现这种感觉的？你从哪里得到这种和谐？

Well, I'm here to tell you that it doesn't come from design committees. It doesn't come from focus groups or market surveys. It doesn't come from cool technology or expensive marketing. And it never happens by accident or by luck. Games with harmony emerge from a fundamental note of clear intention. From design decisions based on an ineffable sense of proportion and rightness. Its presence produces an emotional resonance with its audience. A sense of inner unity that has nothing to do with what or how you did something, it has something to do with why. Myst and Gemstone both have harmony. They have it, because their makers had a vision of the experience they were trying to achieve and the confidence to attain it. They laid down a solid, ambient groove that players and their respective markets can relate to emotionally. They resisted the urge to overbuild. They didn't pile on a lot of gratuitous features just so they could boast about them. And they resisted the temptation to employ inappropriate emotional effects. Effects like shock violence, bad language, inside humor.

好吧，我在这里告诉你，它不是来自设计委员会。它不是来自焦点小组或市场调查。它不是来自炫酷的技术或昂贵的市场营销。它也从来不是偶然或运气使然。和谐的游戏来自于明确的基本意图。它来自于基于不可言喻的比例感和正确性的设计决策。它的存在能与受众产生情感共鸣。一种内在的统一感，它与你做了什么或如何做无关，而是与为什么有关。《神秘岛》和《宝石》都具有和谐感。它们之所以和谐，是因为它们的制作者对所要实现的体验有着远见卓识，并有信心实现这一目标。他们奠定了坚实的氛围基础，让玩家和各自的市场在情感上产生共鸣。他们克制住了过度设计的冲动。他们没有堆砌无用功能来炫耀自己。他们抵制了使用不恰当的情感效果的诱惑，比如震撼的暴力、粗俗的语言、内部笑话。

You know, the suspension of disbelief is fragile. It's hard to achieve it, and hard to maintain. One bit of unnecessary gore, one hip colloquialism, one reference to anything outside the imaginary world you've created is enough to destroy that world. These cheap effects are the most common indicators of a lack of vision or confidence. People who put this stuff into their games are not working hard enough.

要知道，终止怀疑是很脆弱的。很难做到，也很难维持。一点不必要的血腥场面，一句时髦的口语，一次对你所创造的想象世界之外的任何事物的提及，都足以摧毁这个世界。这些糟糕的结果是缺乏远见或信心的最常见表现。往游戏里加入这些东西的人并没有足够努力。

Harmony is essential for a good game world. With every design decision you make, you should ask yourself whether the result is in harmony with your overall vision. Too many games have elements that seem bolted on, last-minute ideas that somebody thought would be “cool” to include. Although every game design requires compromises, as we said in Chapter 1, “What Is Game Design?,” an important part of your job as a designer is to minimize the false notes or off-key elements that compromises tend to create. Try to find a way to make everything fit together into a coherent, integrated whole.

好的游戏世界离不开和谐。在做每一个设计决定时，你都应该问问自己，结果是否与你的整体愿景和谐一致。太多游戏中的元素似乎是临时拼凑的，是某些人认为“很酷”的想法。尽管正如我们在第一章“什么是游戏设计？”中所说的那样，每个游戏设计都需要妥协，但作为设计师，你工作的一个重要任务就是尽量减少妥协带来的假音或跑调元素。努力找到一种方法，让所有东西都能融为一体，成为一个连贯的整体。

A good way to identify games with harmony is to look for those that have lasted far longer in the marketplace than their designers ever expected. This means that something about the game is striking a resonant chord with its players, a chord that continues to echo. For example, people continue to make modifications to Half-Life that are actually more popular than new games because Half-Life is such an elegant, harmonious game. Tetris is another case in point. Action games come and go, but Tetris has stood the test of time and might outlive us all.

识别和谐游戏的一个好方法是寻找那些在市场上持续时间远远超过设计者预期的游戏。这意味着游戏中的某些东西引起了玩家的共鸣，而且这种共鸣还在持续回荡。例如，人们不断对《半条命》进行修改，而这些修改实际上比新游戏更受欢迎，因为《半条命》是一款如此优雅、和谐的游戏。俄罗斯方块是另一个例子。动作游戏来来去去，但俄罗斯方块却经受住了时间的考验，可能会比我们所有人都长寿。
