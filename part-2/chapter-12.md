Sports games set an unusual challenge for the game designer. Unlike most other games, which take place in a world the player knows little about, sports games emulate a world the player knows a lot about: sporting events as they are in real life. No one has ever really led an army of elves into combat, and only a small number of people know how it feels to fly an F-16 fighter jet, but a great many people know what professional football looks like and how the game is played. Sports games belong to a small number of genres that permit a direct comparison with the real world.

体育游戏给游戏设计者带来了不同寻常的挑战。与大多数其他游戏不同，这些游戏发生在玩家知之甚少的世界中，而体育游戏模拟了一个玩家非常了解的世界：现实生活中的体育赛事。没有人真正领导过一支精灵军队作战，只有少数人知道驾驶 F-16 战斗机是什么感觉，但很多人都知道职业橄榄球是什么样子，比赛是如何进行的。体育游戏属于少数可以与现实世界直接比较的游戏类型。

Not all sports games are ultrarealistic, of course. Some, such as Electronic Arts' old Genesis game [Mutant League Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_League_Football), are fantasy games, even if they are based on real sports. Others, such as Midway's arcade game [NFL Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Blitz), simplify a sport and deliberately make it more extreme for dramatic purposes. Most of these kinds of games are designed to appeal to kids, who might not know much about the real sport. But for aficionados, the game must be a reasonably accurate depiction of the real thing, and they will see any deviation as a flaw.

当然，并非所有的体育游戏都是超真实的。有些游戏，如 Electronic Arts 的旧版 Genesis 游戏[《变异联盟橄榄球》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_League_Football)，即使是基于真实体育运动的游戏，也是幻想游戏。还有一些游戏，如 Midway 的街机游戏[《NFL 闪电战》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Blitz)，则简化了某项运动，并故意使其更加极端，以达到戏剧化的目的。这类游戏大多是为了吸引儿童，因为他们可能对真正的体育运动知之甚少。但对于游戏爱好者来说，游戏必须相当准确地描述真实情况，任何偏差都会被他们视为缺陷。

This chapter discusses athletic sports, as opposed to sports such as motor racing. Although racing games are often sold in the sports category, from a design standpoint, they really belong in Chapter 13, "Vehicle Simulations."

本章讨论的是田径运动，而不是赛车等运动。虽然赛车游戏经常在体育类游戏中出售，但从设计的角度来看，它们真正属于[第十三章](/part-2/chapter-13.md)“驾驶工具模拟”。

> **A Note on Terminology 术语说明**
> 
> Because sports games simulate other games, as opposed to a war, a race, or an economic competition of some kind, the words player and game are ambiguous. Does player refer to the person playing the computer game or one of the athletes playing the game on the field? In this chapter, we use the following convention: Player refers to the person playing the computer game, as it does throughout the rest of the book. We call the people in the game athletes. Game refers to the computer game. When we refer to one particular contest, we call it a match. The type of match that the athletes are playing (basketball or soccer, for example) is called the sport.
> 
> 因为体育游戏模拟的是其他游戏，而不是战争、比赛或某种经济竞争，所以玩家和游戏这两个词很模糊。玩家指的是玩电脑游戏的人，还是在赛场上玩游戏的运动员？在本章中，我们采用以下惯例：玩家指的是玩电脑游戏的人，本书其他部分也是如此。我们称游戏中的人为运动员。游戏指的是电脑游戏。当我们提到某场比赛时，我们称之为比赛。运动员进行的比赛类型（例如篮球或足球）称为运动。
> 
> A great many sports involve a playing area with a goal at either end and athletes trying to manipulate some object into the goal. Basketball, ice hockey, water polo, and soccer are all examples. We refer to these collectively as soccerlike games.
> 
> 许多体育运动都有一个比赛场地，两端各有一个球门，运动员试图将某个物体射入球门。篮球、冰上曲棍球、水球和足球都是例子。我们将这些运动统称为类似足球的比赛。

# The Common Elements of Sports Games 体育游戏的共同要素

Using the elements of a game that were established in [Chapter 2](/part-1/chapter-2.md), "Game Concepts," we can observe the following characteristics of serious sports games.

利用[第二章](/part-1/chapter-2.md)“游戏概念”中确定的游戏要素，我们可以观察到严肃体育游戏的以下特征。

## Rules 规则

The rules of a sports game are, for the most part, the rules of the sport that is being simulated. You might find that you need to relax these rules in some areas, particularly with respect to faults, fouls, or judgment errors that the player might make. Because the player is using a handheld device to manipulate an athlete onscreen instead of playing on the field himself, it's much more difficult to judge when his avatar is about to bump into someone, cross into a forbidden zone, and so on. A few games allow the player to set the level of "refereeing" to forgiving or strict, depending on which way he likes to play.

体育游戏的规则在很大程度上就是所模拟的运动项目的规则。你可能会发现在某些方面需要放宽这些规则，尤其是在玩家可能犯的过失、犯规或判断错误方面。因为玩家是用手持设备来操控屏幕上的运动员，而不是亲自上场比赛，所以要判断他的化身什么时候会撞到别人、越过禁区等等，要困难得多。有些游戏允许玩家将“裁判”级别设置为宽容或严格，这取决于他喜欢哪种游戏方式。

You'll also have to address an important question about errors that are not the player's fault. In American football, a certain number of penalties are called each match for "holding," grabbing hold of another athlete instead of merely pushing him. This is an aspect of the sport that a computerized version could avoid entirely: It could simply make it impossible to hold someone. Of course, a match in which no holding penalties ever occurred would feel unrealistic. On the other hand, a match in which holding penalties occurred at random might be frustrating for the player. This is another issue that can be controlled by the refereeing variable described earlier.

你还必须解决一个重要问题，即关于非球员过失的错误。在美式橄榄球比赛中，每场比赛都会有一定数量的“抱人”判罚，即抓住另一名运动员，而不仅仅是推他一把。电脑版美式橄榄球可以完全避免这种情况：电脑版可以完全避免这一点：它可以简单地让“抱人”成为不可能。当然，如果一场比赛中从未出现过“抱人”判罚，就会让人感觉不切实际。另一方面，如果比赛中随意出现抱人判罚，则可能会让球员感到沮丧。这也是另一个可以通过前面描述的裁判变量控制的问题。

## Competition Modes 比赛模式

Sports games are just about the only games that allow all possible modes of competition, depending on the sport: single-player, competitive, cooperative, and in teams, if the platform supports enough input devices. People love to play sports games competitively, and if several people play together, they like to do it in teams as well. Sports games are far more successful on console machines than they are on PCs because console machines allow so many people to play at once and are attached to a TV (usually with a 19-inch screen or better) instead of a monitor, so all the players can see clearly. Because many real sports are played by teams of people, they naturally offer opportunities for multi-player action.

体育游戏是唯一可以根据运动项目提供所有可能的竞技模式的游戏：单人模式、竞技模式、合作模式以及团队模式（如果平台支持足够多的输入设备）。人们喜欢玩体育竞技游戏，如果几个人一起玩，他们还喜欢组队。体育游戏在游戏机上的成功率要比在个人电脑上高得多，因为游戏机可以让很多人同时进行游戏，而且游戏机连接着电视（通常是 19 英寸或更大的屏幕）而不是显示器，这样所有玩家都能看得很清楚。由于许多真正的体育运动都是由多人组队进行的，因此自然也提供了多人游戏的机会。

One other competition mode you should consider including is one with no players at all: the computer versus itself. Few other games besides chess games ever implement this mode; after all, people play computer games to interact, not to watch. However, with sports games, people do occasionally like to let the game play itself and watch the results, just as if they were watching a real match on TV. Another good reason for doing this is to allow the computer to play simulated matches that the player doesn't want to play. This is explained in the section, "Simulating Matches Automatically," later in this chapter.

你应该考虑加入的另一种竞赛模式是完全没有玩家的模式：电脑与自己的对战。除了国际象棋游戏之外，很少有其他游戏采用这种模式；毕竟，人们玩电脑游戏是为了互动，而不是观看。不过，在体育游戏中，人们偶尔会喜欢让游戏自己玩，然后观看比赛结果，就像在电视上观看真正的比赛一样。这样做的另一个很好的理由是，可以让电脑进行玩家不想进行的模拟比赛。本章后面的“自动模拟比赛”一节将对此进行解释。

## Victory and Loss Conditions 胜利和失败条件

The victory and loss conditions for a match are the same as in the real sport. However, many sports played in leagues or by seasons can be simulated in a variety of game modes:

比赛的胜负条件与真实体育比赛中的胜负条件相同。不过，许多以联赛或赛季为单位进行的体育运动可以用多种游戏模式进行模拟：

* **Season mode.** The player selects a single team (or athlete, for individual sports such as skiing) from all those available and plays a series of matches throughout a season, trying to make it into the championships. The schedule of play for the season and the rules for moving into and up the championship bracket are adopted from the real sport. Some season modes allow a player to play not just one team's matches, but every single match played throughout an entire season.\

     **赛季模式。** 玩家从所有可用的运动项目中选择一支队伍（或一名运动员，如滑雪等单项运动），在整个赛季中进行一系列比赛，力争进入锦标赛。赛季的比赛日程和晋级规则均采用真实运动的规则。有些赛季模式不仅允许玩家参加一支球队的比赛，还允许玩家参加整个赛季的所有比赛。

* **Exhibition mode.** In this mode, the players play one single match, but it has no long-term consequences, just like exhibition matches played by real teams. Whoever wins the match, wins the game.\
    
    **表演赛模式。** 在这种模式下，玩家只进行一场比赛，但不产生长期影响，就像真实球队进行的表演赛一样。谁赢得了比赛，谁就赢得了比赛。

* **Sudden death.** As a variant of exhibition mode, players play a match only until the first score is made. Whoever makes the first score wins the match. This is handy for very quick games, although it means that luck plays a much greater role in determining the outcome.\

    **突然死亡。** 作为表演赛模式的一种变体，球员只进行一场比赛，直到取得第一分为止。谁先得分，谁就赢得比赛。这对于速度很快的比赛非常方便，但这意味着运气在决定比赛结果时起着更大的作用。

* **Round robin.** Players in a group each take a team and play each other's team a fixed number of times, sometimes just once. Whoever has won the most matches at the end is the winner.\

    **循环赛。** 一个小组中的球员各带一支队伍，与对方的队伍进行固定次数的比赛，有时只进行一次。最后谁赢得的比赛最多，谁就是赢家。

* **Tournament mode.** In this single-elimination tournament, any player who loses any match is dropped, and the winner goes on to play the winner of another match. This requires that the number of players be a power of two.\

    **锦标赛模式。** 在这种单场淘汰赛中，输掉任何一场比赛的玩家都会被淘汰，获胜者将与另一场比赛的获胜者对战。这要求玩家人数是 2 的幂。

* **Franchise mode.** The player controls a team over the course of several seasons, trying to build its strength through the years. This mode is often found in games that include mechanisms for hiring athletes and trading them among teams. For games such as tennis, in which most athletes play alone, the equivalent mode is called career mode—that is, the player controls the athlete over the course of several years of his or her career.\
    
    **特许经营模式。** 玩家在几个赛季中控制一支球队，试图通过几年的努力增强其实力。这种模式通常出现在包含运动员雇佣和球队间交易机制的游戏中。在网球等游戏中，大多数运动员都是单打独斗，因此相应的模式被称为职业生涯模式，即玩家控制运动员在其职业生涯的若干年中进行比赛。

## Setting 设置

The game's setting is the normal venue for the sport, usually a stadium or an arena. It adds a great deal of verisimilitude to present these accurately. Players enjoy being able to recognize the architectural details of their favorite stadiums. The shape of the actual playing areas in American football and basketball is fixed, but different baseball fields are famous for having different effects on gameplay. Some sports, such as skiing and bobsledding, have venues that vary enormously and require a great deal of practice to learn.

比赛场地是运动的正常场所，通常是体育场或竞技场。准确地呈现这些场馆能增加游戏的真实性。玩家喜欢能够辨认出他们喜爱的体育场馆的建筑细节。美式橄榄球和篮球的实际比赛场地的形状是固定的，但不同的棒球场地会对游戏产生不同的影响。有些运动，如滑雪和雪橇，其场地变化很大，需要大量练习才能掌握。

Outdoor fields are also subject to changes in the weather, which can significantly affect the game. Rain hampers traction on a grass field, and snow makes it worse still. Players have to run more slowly and carefully. Wind affects the flight of balls and the accuracy with which they can be thrown. These factors all add enjoyable variety to a game.

室外场地也会受到天气变化的影响，从而对比赛产生重大影响。下雨会影响草地的牵引力，而下雪则会使情况更糟。球员必须跑得更慢、更小心。风会影响球的飞行和投掷的准确性。这些因素都为比赛增添了乐趣。

The crowd also contributes significantly to the setting. Although you won't want to devote a lot of graphical resources to spectators, the sounds they make add greatly to the atmosphere. The volume should go up at tense moments. If there are any commonly used chants at different times, the players should hear them; there should be cheering after a score by the home team and a sudden silence after a score by the visitors. Horns, whistles, and vendors calling out "Ice-cold beer here!" are all part of the experience.

人群也对比赛环境有很大的影响。虽然你不想在观众身上投入大量的图形资源，但他们发出的声音会大大增加游戏的气氛。在紧张时刻，音量应该提高。如果在不同时刻有任何常用的喊声，球员们应该能听到；主队得分后应该有欢呼声，而客队得分后应该突然安静下来。喇叭声、口哨声和小贩叫卖声 “冰镇啤酒在这里！”都是体验的一部分。

## Interaction Model 互动模式

The interaction model in sports games varies considerably depending on the sport, but in most cases, the player is controlling an avatar who is one of the athletes in the match. In one-on-one sports such as tennis, this is straightforward, but in team sports, the player's control usually switches automatically from one athlete to another as the focus of play changes. In basketball games, for example, control normally switches to the athlete who has the ball. If the player's team is on defense, most games let the player choose which athlete to control and to switch quickly from one to another as conditions change. This often requires significant changes to the user interface as play progresses.

体育游戏中的互动模式因运动项目的不同而有很大差异，但在大多数情况下，玩家控制的是一个化身，而这个化身就是比赛中的一名运动员。在网球等一对一的运动中，这种模式很简单，但在团队运动中，玩家的控制权通常会随着比赛焦点的变化而自动从一名运动员切换到另一名运动员。例如，在篮球比赛中，控制权通常会转交给持球的运动员。如果玩家所在的球队正在防守，大多数游戏都会让玩家选择控制哪名运动员，并在情况发生变化时迅速从一名运动员切换到另一名运动员。这通常需要在游戏过程中对用户界面进行重大改动。

## Perspective 视角

In one-on-one sports games, the perspective is seldom difficult to manage. Choose a spot where you have a clear view of the athletes and where their movements and activities will map neatly onto the machine's input devices. As a general rule, you shouldn't do sports games in the first person. A lot of the fun of watching a sport is in seeing the athletes exercise their skills, and in first person, you can't see your avatar doing that. For example, you could make a tennis game in the first person, but you wouldn't get to see your athlete playing tennis, and you might not even get to see your racket hit the ball. An overhead perspective, with your tennis player at the bottom of the screen and your opponent at the top, presents a much more natural view and lets you see both athletes running, jumping, serving, and so on.

在一对一的体育游戏中，视角很少难以控制。选择一个你能清楚看到运动员的位置，他们的动作和活动也能清晰地映射到机器的输入设备上。一般来说，你不应该以第一人称进行体育游戏。观看体育比赛的很多乐趣在于看到运动员锻炼自己的技能，而在第一人称视角下，你无法看到你的化身在做这些。例如，你可以用第一人称来制作网球游戏，但你看不到你的运动员在打网球，甚至可能看不到你的球拍击球。采用俯视视角，你的网球运动员在屏幕下方，你的对手在屏幕上方，这样呈现的视角要自然得多，你可以看到双方运动员的奔跑、跳跃、发球等动作。

Team games are more tricky, particularly when the focus of attention moves from place to place. With most soccerlike games, an end view or a side view, from a somewhat elevated position, works best. American football, however, is almost unplayable from a side view because too many athletes are behind other athletes and you can't see gaps in the line.

团队游戏则比较棘手，尤其是当注意力从一个地方转移到另一个地方时。对于大多数类似足球的比赛，从稍高的位置看端线或侧线效果最好。而美式橄榄球从侧面看几乎无法进行比赛，因为太多运动员在其他运动员后面，你看不到队伍中的空隙。

## User Interface Design 用户界面设计

In most other genres, the user interface changes infrequently and only in response to explicit actions by the player. Sports games are unusual in this regard; the user interface changes on a second-by-second basis, depending on conditions in the match itself. American football is a particularly complex example. On each play, the player on offense selects the formation and play to be run, then calls signals and makes adjustments at the line of scrimmage, and then takes the snap and either hands off the ball, passes it, or runs with it himself. If he passes it, control switches to the athlete for whom the pass is intended, and a whole series of new options for running, jumping, diving, and dodging defenders comes into play. Each of these different states requires that certain moves or choices be assigned to buttons on the controller, and these assignments change rapidly as play progresses.

在大多数其他类型的游戏中，用户界面的变化并不频繁，而且只有在玩家做出明确操作后才会发生变化。体育游戏在这方面则不同寻常；用户界面每秒都在变化，这取决于比赛本身的情况。美式足球就是一个特别复杂的例子。在每场比赛中，进攻方球员要选择阵型和战术，然后呼叫信号并在争球线上做出调整，然后开球，要么交出球，要么传球，要么自己带球跑。如果他传球，控制权就会转到传球对象的运动员手中，一系列新的跑动、跳跃、俯冲和躲避防守的选择就会出现。每种不同的状态都要求将某些动作或选择分配给控制器上的按钮，而这些分配会随着游戏的进行而迅速变化。

The hardest thing about sports game user interface design is that you have to map athletic activities—complex motions of the whole human body—onto a game machine's input device, typically a handheld controller with binary buttons. Think about what kinds of things the player will want to do at each stage of the game and how best to make them available. Whenever possible, make sure that similar actions in different modes are assigned to similar buttons; for example, if you have a "jump" action in both offensive and defensive modes, assign it to the same button in both cases.

体育游戏用户界面设计的难点在于，你必须将体育活动--整个人体的复杂动作--映射到游戏机的输入设备上，通常是一个带有二进制按钮的手持控制器。想想玩家在游戏的每个阶段会想做哪些事情，以及如何最好地实现这些事情。在可能的情况下，确保将不同模式下的类似动作分配到相似的按钮上；例如，如果你在进攻和防守模式下都有 “跳跃 ”动作，那么在两种情况下都将其分配到相同的按钮上。

In team games, the player will normally be controlling one athlete at a time. This is usually indicated by displaying a circle or star under the athlete's feet. A good many games also draw symbols on the field to help the player overcome the lack of depth perception—the spot where a flying ball is due to land, for example.

在团队游戏中，球员通常一次控制一名运动员。这通常会在运动员脚下显示一个圆圈或星星。很多游戏还会在球场上画出一些符号，帮助玩家克服深度知觉不足的问题--例如，飞来的球将落在哪里。

When the player is on defense, include a button to automatically change control to the most appropriate defending athlete (in soccerlike games, this is usually the one nearest to the ball). Another useful pair of buttons allows the player to cycle control forward and backward through all the athletes on the team.

当玩家处于防守状态时，可通过一个按钮自动将控制权切换到最合适的防守运动员（在类似足球的游戏中，通常是离球最近的运动员）。另一对有用的按钮可以让玩家前后循环控制队中的所有运动员。

Most sports games avoid pull-down menus and anything else that resembles a computer's desktop, so as not to interfere with the fantasy. Pop-up windows and semitransparent overlays are common, particularly if they can be styled to look like the graphics seen on TV. These are subject to style variations from year to year. We suggest that you watch matches on TV for examples of how the overlay graphics are handled.

大多数体育游戏都避免使用下拉菜单和其他类似电脑桌面的东西，以免干扰玩家的幻想。弹出式窗口和半透明覆盖层很常见，特别是如果它们的样式可以看起来像电视上的画面。这些样式每年都会有所不同。我们建议你观看电视上的比赛，以了解如何处理叠加图形。

Unless you're simulating archery or bowling, don't forget that a sports game is essentially an action game. No matter how complex the sport is, the user interface must be as smooth and intuitive as you can make it.

除非是模拟射箭或保龄球，否则不要忘记体育游戏本质上就是动作游戏。无论这项运动有多复杂，用户界面都必须尽可能地流畅和直观。

## Player Roles

玩家角色

The player's role is most commonly that of an athlete, but not one particular athlete. In a team sport, the player's focus of control usually follows the action rather than being tied to a single individual. Thus, the player's role shifts rapidly, especially if some athletes play specialized positions such as catcher or goalie.

球员的角色最常见的是运动员，但不是某个运动员。在团队运动中，球员的控制重心通常是跟着动作走，而不是绑在某个人身上。因此，运动员的角色转换很快，尤其是当一些运动员担任专门的位置（如捕手或守门员）时。

Another common role is that of coach, again seen chiefly in team sports. The coach selects the starting players for the team, sets offensive and defensive strategies, and makes player substitutions during the match. The player usually switches to the coach role during timeouts or other pauses in the action.

另一个常见的角色是教练，同样主要出现在团队运动中。教练为球队挑选首发球员，制定进攻和防守策略，并在比赛中替换球员。球员通常在暂停或其他比赛暂停时转换为教练角色。

Finally, there's the role of general manager of the team. The general manager is respon sible for hiring and firing decisions and trying to recruit the best players within the limitations of the budget. See Figure 12.1 for an example. A few sports games are about only this aspect of the sport and don't include live simulations of the sport itself. These are occasionally called manager games and are particularly popular in Europe.

最后是球队总经理的角色。总经理负责做出聘用和解雇的决定，并努力在预算范围内招募最好的球员。示例见图 12.1。少数体育游戏只涉及体育运动的这一方面，而不包括体育运动本身的现场模拟。这些游戏有时被称为经理人游戏，在欧洲特别流

Figure 12.1. EA's Madden NFL 2002 athlete-trading screen, a management function. 图 12.1. EA 的《疯狂橄榄球 2002》（Madden NFL 2002）运动员交易屏幕，这是一种管理功能。

## Structure 结构

The structure of a sports game is typically simple. Its main play mode is match play, simulating the sport itself as it is played. You can usually pause the game and bring up a pause menu. While the game is paused, you can substitute athletes, change the camera view, adjust the AI if it can be adjusted, and perform other sorts of coaching tasks. You can also save the game for later or abandon it.

体育游戏的结构通常很简单。它的主要游戏模式是比赛，模拟运动本身的比赛过程。你通常可以暂停比赛并调出暂停菜单。在比赛暂停时，你可以替换运动员、改变摄像机视角、调整人工智能（如果可以调整的话）以及执行其他各种教练任务。你还可以保存比赛以备后用，或者放弃比赛。

Outside of match play, most of the game's modes relate to other aspects of the sport: studying the athletes' ratings and performance statistics, hiring and trading them, establishing a depth chart, and following the sport's playing schedule on a calendar. The screen layouts tend to reflect the bookkeeping nature of these activities, often resembling tables or graphs.

在比赛之外，游戏的大部分模式都与体育运动的其他方面有关：研究运动员的评级和表现统计、雇佣和交易运动员、建立深度表，以及在日历上关注运动的比赛日程。屏幕布局倾向于反映这些活动的记账性质，通常类似于表格或图表。

# Special Design Issues for Sports Games

Sports games face a number of design issues that are either rare or irrelevant in other kinds of games.

## Physics for Sports Games

During play, your game will be running a physics engine that determines the behavior of moving bodies in the match. The physical behavior of an inanimate object such as a baseball is comparatively easy to implement. The physical behavior of humans, however, is much more complicated. Early sports games tended to treat a running athlete rather like a rocket: She had a velocity vector that gave the speed and direction of her movement, and an acceleration vector that gave the force and direction with which she was pushing. Modern sports games have much richer simulations with a great many variables, taking into account such things as the friction coefficient of the playing surface—for example, rain and snow make fields slippery and reduce traction.

Designing the physics simulation for a sports game is a highly technical problem and is beyond the scope of this book. However, we offer one caveat: Because a sports game is a simulation of the real world, it is a common error to think that the physics in a sports game should be as realistic as possible. They shouldn't be, for two reasons:

First, the player is not actually running around on the playing field herself; she is sitting in a chair, watching a screen, and controlling an athlete through a handheld controller. She has neither the immediate experience of being on the field nor the precise control over her movements that a real athlete does.

Second, the player is not a professional athlete. There is a good reason why only a small number of people are capable of hitting a baseball pitched at 95 miles per hour. The length of time that the ball is within reach of the bat is about 0.04 seconds. It's simply not realistic to expect that an ordinary person, looking at a video screen without the benefit of depth perception, could react that fast.

For both of these reasons, it's necessary to fudge the physics to make the game playable. We slow the pitch so that the batter has a reasonable chance of hitting it, and we artificially adjust the position of the bat so that it intersects the path of the ball. It doesn't matter whether the physics perfectly copy the real world as much as whether they seem to be producing a reasonable simulation of the sport as it is played by professionals. Even in a highly realistic game, your objective is to provide an enjoyable experience, not a mathematical simulation of nature.

## Rating the Athletes

One of the biggest tasks you have in designing a sports game is developing a rating system for the skills and athletic abilities of all the athletes in the game. The rating system provides the raw data that the physics engine needs to simulate the behavior of the athletes accurately. As your programming team develops the physics engine and game AI, you should work with them to determine what ratings are needed. Researching the athletes' performance and setting the ratings for them is a task that can take many months, and you will probably want to delegate it to junior designers or assistant producers.

In most team games, the athletes have one set of ratings common to all of them, plus specialized ratings that apply only to athletes playing a particular position.

### Common Ratings

These are examples of the kinds of ratings that might be common to all the athletes in a game:

Speed. The athlete's maximum moving (running or skating or swimming) speed under ideal conditions.

Agility. A measure of the athlete's ability to change directions while moving.

Weight. Simply the athlete's weight, which affects the force he transmits in a collision and the inertia he has when struck by someone else.

Acceleration. The rate at which the athlete can reach top speed.

Jumping. The height to which the athlete can jump.

Endurance. The rate at which the athlete gets tired during the course of the game.

Injury resistance. The probability that an athlete will be injured.

### Specialized Ratings

These ratings apply to a specific position—in this case, the quarterback in American football:

Passing strength. The distance that the quarterback can throw the ball.

Passing accuracy. The precision with which the quarterback can throw the ball.

Dexterity. The quarterback's general dexterity in handling the ball. This affects his chances of dropping the snap or fumbling a handoff.

Awareness. The quarterback's ability to sense that he's about to be tackled and to try to get out of the way.

## Athlete AI Design

The AI in most computer games is rather crude. In action games and first-person shooters, the player's AI-driven opponents typically have a small number of behaviors triggered by specific events (appearance of the player on the scene, being shot at, and so on). When they're together in a group, they very seldom act in concert or assign special roles to particular individuals, nor do they help each other. It's every monster for itself. When there are no stimuli, they go into a simple idle loop, walking aimlessly around or standing still.

These kinds of actions aren't acceptable in a sports game. People don't mind if a monster in a first-person shooter wanders randomly around, but the athletes in a sports game must behave like humans, and that means deliberate, intelligent action. Particularly in team games, each athlete is working with the others on the team to accomplish particular goals. The position the athlete plays dictates behavior to some extent, but within those boundaries, the athlete still has to respond intelligently to a number of possible events. In a relatively simple sport such as tennis, there might not be many of these events, but in a highly complex sport such as American football, with 22 players on the field at a time, there can be hundreds.

### Defining the State Space

The best way to design sports-game AI is to map out a game's states as a giant flowchart. There could be far more states than you realize at first. Corner kick in soccer is not just one state, but several. There is the period before the ball is kicked, after it has been kicked but has not yet touched another athlete, after it has been touched by another athlete, and so on. See Figure 12.2 for a partial example.

Figure 12.2. A flowchart detailing part of the "corner kick" situation in soccer.

graphics/12fig02.gif

Consult the official rules of the sport as you construct the flowchart: They will often describe states in detail, with special rules applying to each. However, the rules alone are not enough; they describe game states for the purposes of listing legal and illegal actions, but not for tactics or strategy. Whenever something changes that requires the athletes to adopt a different tactic, the game has moved into a different state.

### Setting Collective and Individual Goals

After you define the game states, you can start thinking about what the team should do in that state—where each athlete should be trying to go and what he should be trying to do to support the team's collective goal at that moment. In some cases, these activities are defined with reference to a specific individual on the opposing team, trying to prevent him from doing his job. The software must have a way of matching up athletes with their opponents, just as the real athletes do.

When you have defined what the team should be trying to accomplish in a particular state and have assigned each athlete a role, you then must define exactly how the athlete is to perform that role: what direction he moves, what other movements he makes, which animations should be displayed, and so on. If the role is a defensive or supportive one, such as covering an opposing athlete, the individual AI for it might still be fairly complex. For example, a soccer player dribbling the ball might make a feint, trying to fool his opponent into thinking he's passing the ball. The software knows perfectly well that this is a feint, but sometimes the defender should be fooled and sometimes he shouldn't, depending on his awareness rating and, in either case, how he responds.

An athlete with nothing to do shouldn't just stand still. Most sports games include fidgets, short animations in which the athlete shifts his weight, stretches his arms, or makes some other neutral action every few seconds. Even if play is underway but the athlete is not closely involved—the third baseman on a fly ball to right field, for example—he at least should turn and watch the action.

## Injuries

Injuries are a sad but common side effect of sports, and serious simulations take them into account. Because they occur somewhat randomly, they're outside the player's control and can be frustrating. Most sports games allow the players to turn off injuries if they don't like the effect that they have on the game.

Although it's possible for an athlete to injure herself simply by running or jumping, this doesn't provide the player with any visible explanation for why the injury occurred. A lot of sports games therefore limit injuries to cases in which there has been a collision of some kind, usually between two athletes. To determine whether an injury has occurred, you should include such factors as the relative speed of the two athletes, their weights, their respective susceptibilities to injury, and a random factor. The heavier an athlete is, the more force she imparts in a collision, and it is the force that does the damage to the other athlete.

Some positions, such as the pitcher in baseball, are simply so stressful that they can result in injuries without a collision, especially the longer the pitcher stays in the game. You can compute the probability of an injury on every pitch and raise it slightly with each one.

You can also decide which part of the body sustained the injury and the length of time for which it will disable the athlete. Study reports of injuries and recovery times for the sport you are simulating. If your game tracks athletes over a period of time, you will have to consider the cumulative effect of injury and recovery time on their careers.

## Arcade Mode Versus Simulation Mode

Arcade mode versus simulation mode is a realism switch that lets the player adjust the behavior of the game to suit his tastes. Arcade mode makes the game more exciting at the expense of realism; simulation mode makes it a more accurate simulation of the real sport at some expense in fun. For example, in baseball, an athlete is doing well if he has a .333 batting average—that is, gets a hit only one time in three. Some players might find that a little dull. Switching the game to arcade mode could let the player get a hit 50 percent of the time or even more. It skews the play toward lots of action and relatively few strikeouts or walks. In American football, you could artificially increase the number of completed passes by improving the quarterback's throwing accuracy and the receiver's catching skills.

To implement arcade mode, you'll have to decide what sort of changes to the real game would make it more exciting. If you want your game to have both arcade and simulation modes, we recommend that you start with the serious simulation first and then design the "fudges" that make it arcadelike. Serious simulations are much more difficult to tune, and it's important to get them right first. If you start with an arcadelike design and then try to make it serious, you might never get it right.

## Simulating Matches Automatically

Sports games that can play an entire season for a whole league of teams often provide a means of simulating matches automatically, without the player having to play them. For example, each team in professional baseball plays 162 matches in a season. With 30 teams and 2 teams in each match, this is a total of 2,430 matches—only the most rabid fan would want to play them all personally. To generate results for matches that the player doesn't play, you need a way of simulating a match. Of course, you'll want the resulting scores to accurately reflect the relative strengths of the teams: A bad team should be able to beat a good team occasionally, but not often.

### Computer Versus Computer

The simplest way to simulate matches automatically is to let the computer play out the match in computer versus computer mode, as described in the section, "Competition Modes," earlier in this chapter, and record the results. If the game's simulation model is good, it should produce scores that reflect the real abilities of the competitors. Unfortunately, this is a slow way to do it. If the player wants to generate results for a match that she doesn't really care about, she probably wants it done quickly.

### Simulation Without Graphics

One solution is to simulate the whole match exactly as in computer versus computer mode, but to turn off the graphics so that nothing is displayed. Because displaying the graphics often takes up the majority of the computer's time, an entire match can be simulated in a few seconds. Electronic Arts' Earl Weaver Baseball game did this successfully. It makes the programming more complicated, however, because throughout the whole program, there have to be checks to see if the game is in simulation mode or display mode. When you do this, test the game to be sure that the results without graphics are the same as those with graphics.

### Faking It

The alternative many games adopt is to fake it—in effect, to roll dice to generate game scores. The dice are loaded somewhat so that good teams get high scores and bad teams get low ones, and whichever team rolls the highest score wins the match. You will need to devise a suitable algorithm for generating point values: In games such as American football and rugby, in which different numbers of points are awarded for different kinds of scores (touchdown, field goal, and so on), certain score values are much more common than others. It's extremely rare, for example, for a team to end an American football game with a score of 2. You'll also need to make sure that your algorithm creates a reasonable random distribution; no professional soccer game should ever end with a score over about 15.

One disadvantage of this dice-rolling technique is that it doesn't generate any other statistics besides the scores themselves. In a particularly statistics-rich sport such as baseball, if you don't generate performance data for each individual player, some fans will consider your game to be a lightweight, not a serious, simulation. It's up to you to decide just how important that market is to you and how much effort you're prepared to exert to meet their expectations.

## Licenses, Trademarks, and Publicity Rights

Many years ago, small developers could make and sell computer games using names such as "NFL" and get away with it, because the National Football League never knew it was happening. You can't do this now. Interactive entertainment is big business, and you have to be scrupulously careful to avoid violating trademarks or personal publicity rights.

### Team and League Trademarks

The exact details vary from league to league and country to country, but generally in America, the name, logo, uniform design, and other indicia of all the teams in a league, plus the name and logo of the league itself, are licensed for use by the league. You, or your publisher, will have to negotiate an agreement with the league to use these symbols in your game. Before Electronic Arts signed an agreement with the NFL, early versions of John Madden Football referred to teams only by their town names (such as San Francisco or Chicago) rather than by their team names (the 49ers and the Bears) and did not show any logos. The colors of the uniforms were similar but not exactly the same. You can pull this trick, too, if you dare, but you're risking a lawsuit if you get too close.

Individual sports, such as gymnastics or figure skating, are often governed by a variety of bodies in different countries around the world. The names and indicia of particular events, such as the Kentucky Derby, are owned by the organizations that produce them—in this case, the Churchill Downs racetrack. In recent years, these groups have begun to exploit their intellectual property rights in a variety of ways, so they tend to come down hard on anything that seems to be an infringement. Don't assume that just because an event has been around for decades, you can freely use its name.

### Personal Publicity Rights

You cannot use the name or photograph of a real athlete without permission. An athlete's name and likeness are part of his personal publicity rights, and, of course, famous athletes sell the rights to use their names for millions of dollars when they endorse a particular product as an individual. You might need to negotiate with an organization that licenses the rights to use all the players' names collectively. This might be the league, in some cases; in others, however, including the NFL and Major League Baseball, you have to contact the athletes' unions. And unless you have the endorsement of a specific athlete, you must make sure that your game displays all athletes in approximately the same way, or endorsement could be implied. You can't make it look as if an athlete has endorsed your game when that's not the case.

Photographs present further difficulties. You must obtain a license from the person in the photograph and also from the person who took the photograph: the photograph's copyright holder. Again, some governing bodies have special clearinghouses for these kinds of things: NFL Photos is a special department of the NFL that licenses still photos for all the photographers who are accredited to take pictures at NFL matches. The license, however, does not grant you the personal publicity rights of the athlete in the picture; you have to obtain those separately. You can also license photos from the trading card companies, as well as from journalistic bodies such as the Associated Press, and from private photo libraries.

In short, the whole issue of rights in sports games is a legal minefield. Nowadays, even the stadiums might claim special rights, and many stadium owners auction the name of the stadium to the highest bidder, as with 3Com Park in San Francisco. As a designer, you probably won't have to deal with obtaining all these licenses yourself, but you should know that it's not safe to specify simply that a game will use all the team and player names and photos. Obtaining them and the right to use them is a very costly and time-consuming business. It's best to design the game in such a way that it doesn't depend on having these things, unless you're certain that they will be available.

## Audio Commentary

Most sports games try to reproduce the experience of watching the sport on television. An important part of that experience is hearing the announcers' commentary, or play-by-play. Most TV and radio sports broadcasts include at least two people, the play-by-play man and the color commentator. The play-by-play man describes the play on a moment-by-moment basis. The color commentator, usually a retired coach or player, offers insights about strategy and tactics, as well as background material on the teams or individual players. A third voice that you occasionally hear is that of the stadium announcer over the public address system. His remarks tend to be quite formulaic, although they do occasionally include requests to move misparked cars, retrieve found children, and so on.

### Defining the Events to Describe

A good way to size up the job of duplicating the audio experience is to record a TV broadcast of a real match and then transcribe everything that is said and by whom. Do this for two or three matches, and you will begin to notice patterns in the play-by-play: The announcers tend to announce the score at particular times, they use certain repetitive language, and so on. As you watch the match on videotape, take note of the different kinds of events that occur and the different remarks they elicit from the commentators. The color commentator's events aren't the same as the play-by-play man's. The color commentator speaks at more dramatic moments, or when an athlete has done something particularly spectacular (or particularly bad). For example, in tennis, you might have a color comment like, "She's having a terrible time with those double faults" when an athlete commits four double faults in a single game. Be sure you play it only once, however—not on every subsequent double fault.

When you have a set of match events that you want to create commentary for, sit down with the programmers and discuss them to make sure they are detectable. Some, such as a strikeout in baseball, will be uncomplicated, but a lot of them will be judgment calls. For example, a dropped pass in football that the player really should have caught is not so easily detectable; you can detect the dropped pass, but what determines whether he should have caught it? It must be calculated from such things as the receiver's dexterity rating and the accuracy with which the pass was thrown in the first place—provided that it wasn't tipped away by a defender. It's always best to err on the side of caution in these cases: Don't design judgment calls that the player is likely to disagree with, or he'll think your game is stupid. As the saying goes, "It's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than open one's mouth and remove all doubt."

Don't forget the introductory and wrap-up material at the beginning and end of the match—for example, "Welcome to Mile High Stadium for today's game between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos. It's a cold and windy day."

### Writing the Script

When you have established the events that need audio commentary, you can start to write the audio recording script that will implement it. For each event, you will typically want to record four or five variant comments so that the players don't hear the same thing every time the event occurs. Obviously, the more comments you can write per event, the better your game will sound. The number of comments is really limited only by the available space on the distribution medium and the number of things you can reasonably think of to say about a given event.

As you write the script, you will discover places where a name or number will need to be included, usually the names of athletes or teams or the current score. If the sport is one with a large number of athletes, you cannot afford to record the sentence with every possible athlete's name in it. Instead, you will need to record the sentence as a whole using a sample name and edit the resulting audio file into clips, one part before the name and one part after. Your programmers must devise a method of streaming the sound clips, inserting the correct name in the right place in such a way that they sound seamless. When you record the sentence, use a sample name that begins and ends with a T or a K sound so that it doesn't slur into the rest of the sentence and so that it can be cut cleanly. For example, "Merrick steps up to the free throw line" enables the engineer to cut between Merrick and steps, whereas "Rogers steps up to the free throw line" would produce a slur from Rogers into steps.

Whenever possible, you should try to write the script in such a way that names are at either the beginning or the end of a sentence. You can then have your voice talent record the names of all the athletes who appear in the game. Each name will need to be recorded twice, once using the voice inflection for the beginning of a sentence, and once at the end. Don't try to record the names by themselves; record a complete sentence and then throw away all but the name, for example, "Thomas takes it" and "I'll pick Thomas." Again, using the T and K sounds adjacent to the name allows a clean cut in the audio.

Case Study: Madden NFL Football

Madden NFL Football is one of the longest-established and best-selling game franchises in the history of our industry. From its earliest beginnings on the Apple II, it has grown into a financial powerhouse that produces a new edition on several different platforms every year and makes millions of dollars for its publisher, Electronic Arts. Versions of Madden have appeared for personal computers and every major console machine ever produced.

Madden is not redesigned every year, nor is its code rewritten. Its artwork and video sequences are updated, and it gets new features each year, but it undergoes a complete overhaul only every four or five years—often when a new generation of game console appears. The majority of the design work each year consists of tuning and improving the gameplay and adding more features. These features expand the "football experience" to include aspects of the sport that go beyond playing a single match against another team. Among them are the following:

Ability to hire and trade players among teams, subject to the limitations of the salary cap established by the NFL.

Participation in the NFL draft.

Detailed performance statistics on players.

Season, tournament, and practice modes.

Franchise mode, letting players take a team through several seasons in an effort to build a dynasty.

A play editor, allowing players to customize their playbooks.

Madden University, which includes detailed tutorials about offensive and defensive strategies, commentaries on the strengths and weaknesses of each team, and historical background.

Adjustable AI, enabling players to set the coaching stances of computer-controlled teams to aggressive, neutral, or conservative.

Arcade mode, a simplified and exaggerated form of the game.

As you can see, even though the sport itself changes little from year to year, new features and details can always be added to a sports game.

By far, the largest single task in developing Madden every year is research: rating the skills of the real players who appear in the game, keeping track of which team they're playing for, finding photographs of them, and so on. In addition to researching the players, the production team must research the coaches—trying to find out what kinds of plays they like to run, whether they're aggressive or conservative, and so on. The team's playbooks must be updated every year to reflect changes in coaching practice, and the new plays must be tested to make sure that they're effective but not unstoppable.

In short, Madden is a highly successful sports game that offers its players a wide range of playing styles, from the quick and easy arcade game to the detailed minutiae of designing plays and adjusting rosters. As a game that tries to "do it all," it's well worth studying.

## Other Peculiarities

The following sections detail a few other issues peculiar to sports games.

### Invented Sports

From time to time, someone tries to create a sports video game of a completely invented sport, as opposed to a take-off of an existing one. Empire Interactive's Speedball 2100 was one such game. Experience shows, however, that this is a risky enterprise. Hardcore sports gamers are seldom interested in completely new sports; they'd rather play a game that simulates a sport that they're already familiar with. Other types of gamers aren't that interested in sports games anyway and aren't very likely to want to play a one-off sports game unless it appeals to them for some other reason. If you're thinking of inventing a new sport specifically for a video game, we advise you to design it as a video game, without concerning yourself with what it might be like in the real world. This is how Speedball was designed; although it was theoretically a sport, it included powerups and other arcade-game elements to make it more interesting.

As we said earlier, one of the trickiest aspects of sports game design is mapping real-world activities to a limited input device. Players are willing to tolerate some awkwardness in the user interface when it's a real sport because they understand the problems. With an invented sport, they're unlikely to be so generous. When designing a completely new sport, you might consider working backward from the controller to the sport itself, designing around the limitations of your hardware.

### Instant Replay

Instant replay is now an essential part of watching sports on television, so naturally video game players want it as well. It's not difficult to design, although it might be difficult to implement. Your game will need to keep track of the exact position and animation step of every player and other key objects on the field in each game frame. When the player requests an instant replay (usually through a pause menu), the game can play them back. Of course there is a limit to how much of this information you can keep around, and some natural boundary is likely to suggest itself—in baseball, the time since the most recent pitch; in American football, the time since the ball was snapped. In continuously flowing games such as basketball, you might have to establish an artificial time limit.

The best instant-replay mechanisms allow all the following features for maximum flexibility:

Play, stop, fast-forward, rewind, and single-frame advance and reverse operations, to allow the player to see exactly what happened at every instant.

The ability to move the camera in all three dimensions.

The ability to pitch the camera up and down, and turn (panning) it left and right.

The ability to lock the camera to a given athlete or the ball, to follow something wherever it goes. This is usually done by showing a symbol on the ground that represents the camera's focus of attention. If the symbol is directly under an athlete's feet when the player stops moving the camera, the camera locks onto that athlete.

Instant replay lets the players see the action from perspectives that they can't use when actually playing the game. For the game's publisher and developer, it's an invaluable tool for grabbing dramatic screen shots or gameplay footage for sales and demonstrations. You should consider it an essential feature of any sports game that you design.

Camera Difficulties in Games with Widely Separated Action

In most sports, the focus of the action is in one location. In a race, it's on the leaders. In any soccerlike sport (soccer, hockey, basketball, water polo, and so on), it's on the object that's supposed to go into the goal; similarly, in any tennislike sport, it's on the ball. Baseball and cricket are unusual in that the action takes place in two places at once: where the ball is and also where the runners are. In baseball, this can be as much as 400 feet away. You can't show both the runners and the ball without zooming out to a blimp view so high up that nobody can see anything clearly.

To solve this, most baseball video games implement a picture-in-picture solution: The camera follows the ball, but a small diagram of the baseball diamond in one corner of the screen shows the positions of the runners, often as no more than colored dots (see Figure 12.3). When a runner reaches a base, his dot changes color to indicate that he is safe. The player controlling the fielders watches the main screen, and the one controlling the runners watches the diagram (keeping one eye on the main screen to see if the ball is coming). Because cricket has only two stumps instead of four bases, this arrangement is even easier.

### Home-Field Advantage

Considerable debate has raged over the years about whether to build a home-field advantage into sports games. Although the home-field advantage is statistically significant in a number of sports, we recommend against it. Players like to feel that they are playing a fair game, and if they know that the odds are artificially stacked against them whenever they play an "away" game, they will resent it. It's also unclear exactly how the home-field advantage should be implemented. The phenomenon is normally observed from win-loss statistics, but, of course, the computer can't simply turn a loss into a win. It could shave off a percentage of goal-scoring attempts, but even this is likely to have odd side effects. If a scoring attempt that clearly should have succeeded fails for no visible reason, the players are bound to notice it.

Sports Game Worksheet

In designing a sports game, consider the following questions as a starting point:

What sport am I simulating? Is it a real sport or a made-up one? If it's real, do I want to get a license from a governing body?

What are the rules of my sport? If it's a real sport, can I really implement them all, or will it have to be a subset?

What competition modes am I going to offer—single-player, competitive, cooperative, teams? Which ones make sense for my sport, and which don't?

In addition to playing a single match, what other game modes will I offer? Season, tournament, franchise, career?

What is the best perspective for playing my sport? Directly overhead, from the sidelines, from some other angle? What intelligence needs to be built into the camera to make the game easy to play? How will I handle displaying actions at widely separated points?

How do I map the actions of an athlete, or an entire team of athletes, to the controls available to the player? Will the functions of the buttons need to change during the course of play? When and why? What additional markings should I draw on the field of play to compensate for the player's lack of depth perception? What pop-up windows over the play will the player need, and how do I prevent those from obscuring the action? When play is not in progress, how does the rest of the user interface look and work?

What roles will the player play in the sport? Athlete, coach, general manager? When does the player switch from one to another and why?

What's the general structure of the game? What screens do I need, and how do they lead from one to another? Can the player trade athletes among teams in the middle of the season, for example?

What changes will I need to make to the physics of the sport to make it playable by ordinary mortals?

What characteristics describe an athlete's abilities? How will they affect the way her behavior looks on the screen? Will some athletes have ratings peculiar to the positions they play?

What states can the game be in, even in times between active play? How does an athlete behave in each state? What are her goals in each state, and in team play, what is the collective goal of the team in each state? How does the individual athlete's behavior contribute to meeting the team's goal?

Am I going to offer automatic simulation of matches? How will that be done?

What will the audio commentary be like? What events will it cover?

How does instant replay work?
