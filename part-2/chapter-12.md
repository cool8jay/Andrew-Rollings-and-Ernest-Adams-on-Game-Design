Sports games set an unusual challenge for the game designer. Unlike most other games, which take place in a world the player knows little about, sports games emulate a world the player knows a lot about: sporting events as they are in real life. No one has ever really led an army of elves into combat, and only a small number of people know how it feels to fly an F-16 fighter jet, but a great many people know what professional football looks like and how the game is played. Sports games belong to a small number of genres that permit a direct comparison with the real world.

体育游戏给游戏设计者带来了不同寻常的挑战。与大多数其他游戏不同，这些游戏发生在玩家知之甚少的世界中，而体育游戏模拟了一个玩家非常了解的世界：现实生活中的体育赛事。没有人真正领导过一支精灵军队作战，只有少数人知道驾驶 F-16 战斗机是什么感觉，但很多人都知道职业橄榄球是什么样子，比赛是如何进行的。体育游戏属于少数可以与现实世界直接比较的游戏类型。

Not all sports games are ultrarealistic, of course. Some, such as Electronic Arts' old Genesis game [Mutant League Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_League_Football), are fantasy games, even if they are based on real sports. Others, such as Midway's arcade game [NFL Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Blitz), simplify a sport and deliberately make it more extreme for dramatic purposes. Most of these kinds of games are designed to appeal to kids, who might not know much about the real sport. But for aficionados, the game must be a reasonably accurate depiction of the real thing, and they will see any deviation as a flaw.

当然，并非所有的体育游戏都是超真实的。有些游戏，如 Electronic Arts 的旧版 Genesis 游戏[《变异联盟橄榄球》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_League_Football)，即使是基于真实体育运动的游戏，也是幻想游戏。还有一些游戏，如 Midway 的街机游戏[《NFL 闪电战》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Blitz)，则简化了某项运动，并故意使其更加极端，以达到戏剧化的目的。这类游戏大多是为了吸引儿童，因为他们可能对真正的体育运动知之甚少。但对于游戏爱好者来说，游戏必须相当准确地描述真实情况，任何偏差都会被他们视为缺陷。

This chapter discusses athletic sports, as opposed to sports such as motor racing. Although racing games are often sold in the sports category, from a design standpoint, they really belong in Chapter 13, "Vehicle Simulations."

本章讨论的是田径运动，而不是赛车等运动。虽然赛车游戏经常在体育类游戏中出售，但从设计的角度来看，它们真正属于[第十三章](/part-2/chapter-13.md)“驾驶工具模拟”。

> **A Note on Terminology 术语说明**
> 
> Because sports games simulate other games, as opposed to a war, a race, or an economic competition of some kind, the words player and game are ambiguous. Does player refer to the person playing the computer game or one of the athletes playing the game on the field? In this chapter, we use the following convention: Player refers to the person playing the computer game, as it does throughout the rest of the book. We call the people in the game athletes. Game refers to the computer game. When we refer to one particular contest, we call it a match. The type of match that the athletes are playing (basketball or soccer, for example) is called the sport.
> 
> 因为体育游戏模拟的是其他游戏，而不是战争、比赛或某种经济竞争，所以玩家和游戏这两个词很模糊。玩家指的是玩电脑游戏的人，还是在赛场上玩游戏的运动员？在本章中，我们采用以下惯例：玩家指的是玩电脑游戏的人，本书其他部分也是如此。我们称游戏中的人为运动员。游戏指的是电脑游戏。当我们提到某场比赛时，我们称之为比赛。运动员进行的比赛类型（例如篮球或足球）称为运动。
> 
> A great many sports involve a playing area with a goal at either end and athletes trying to manipulate some object into the goal. Basketball, ice hockey, water polo, and soccer are all examples. We refer to these collectively as soccerlike games.
> 
> 许多体育运动都有一个比赛场地，两端各有一个球门，运动员试图将某个物体射入球门。篮球、冰上曲棍球、水球和足球都是例子。我们将这些运动统称为类似足球的比赛。

# The Common Elements of Sports Games 体育游戏的共同要素

Using the elements of a game that were established in [Chapter 2](/part-1/chapter-2.md), "Game Concepts," we can observe the following characteristics of serious sports games.

利用[第二章](/part-1/chapter-2.md)“游戏概念”中确定的游戏要素，我们可以观察到严肃体育游戏的以下特征。

## Rules 规则

The rules of a sports game are, for the most part, the rules of the sport that is being simulated. You might find that you need to relax these rules in some areas, particularly with respect to faults, fouls, or judgment errors that the player might make. Because the player is using a handheld device to manipulate an athlete onscreen instead of playing on the field himself, it's much more difficult to judge when his avatar is about to bump into someone, cross into a forbidden zone, and so on. A few games allow the player to set the level of "refereeing" to forgiving or strict, depending on which way he likes to play.

体育游戏的规则在很大程度上就是所模拟的运动项目的规则。你可能会发现在某些方面需要放宽这些规则，尤其是在玩家可能犯的过失、犯规或判断错误方面。因为玩家是用手持设备来操控屏幕上的运动员，而不是亲自上场比赛，所以要判断他的化身什么时候会撞到别人、越过禁区等等，要困难得多。有些游戏允许玩家将“裁判”级别设置为宽容或严格，这取决于他喜欢哪种游戏方式。

You'll also have to address an important question about errors that are not the player's fault. In American football, a certain number of penalties are called each match for "holding," grabbing hold of another athlete instead of merely pushing him. This is an aspect of the sport that a computerized version could avoid entirely: It could simply make it impossible to hold someone. Of course, a match in which no holding penalties ever occurred would feel unrealistic. On the other hand, a match in which holding penalties occurred at random might be frustrating for the player. This is another issue that can be controlled by the refereeing variable described earlier.

你还必须解决一个重要问题，即关于非球员过失的错误。在美式橄榄球比赛中，每场比赛都会有一定数量的“抱人”判罚，即抓住另一名运动员，而不仅仅是推他一把。电脑版美式橄榄球可以完全避免这种情况：电脑版可以完全避免这一点：它可以简单地让“抱人”成为不可能。当然，如果一场比赛中从未出现过“抱人”判罚，就会让人感觉不切实际。另一方面，如果比赛中随意出现抱人判罚，则可能会让球员感到沮丧。这也是另一个可以通过前面描述的裁判变量控制的问题。

## Competition Modes 比赛模式

Sports games are just about the only games that allow all possible modes of competition, depending on the sport: single-player, competitive, cooperative, and in teams, if the platform supports enough input devices. People love to play sports games competitively, and if several people play together, they like to do it in teams as well. Sports games are far more successful on console machines than they are on PCs because console machines allow so many people to play at once and are attached to a TV (usually with a 19-inch screen or better) instead of a monitor, so all the players can see clearly. Because many real sports are played by teams of people, they naturally offer opportunities for multi-player action.

体育游戏是唯一可以根据运动项目提供所有可能的竞技模式的游戏：单人模式、竞技模式、合作模式以及团队模式（如果平台支持足够多的输入设备）。人们喜欢玩体育竞技游戏，如果几个人一起玩，他们还喜欢组队。体育游戏在游戏机上的成功率要比在个人电脑上高得多，因为游戏机可以让很多人同时进行游戏，而且游戏机连接着电视（通常是 19 英寸或更大的屏幕）而不是显示器，这样所有玩家都能看得很清楚。由于许多真正的体育运动都是由多人组队进行的，因此自然也提供了多人游戏的机会。

One other competition mode you should consider including is one with no players at all: the computer versus itself. Few other games besides chess games ever implement this mode; after all, people play computer games to interact, not to watch. However, with sports games, people do occasionally like to let the game play itself and watch the results, just as if they were watching a real match on TV. Another good reason for doing this is to allow the computer to play simulated matches that the player doesn't want to play. This is explained in the section, "Simulating Matches Automatically," later in this chapter.

你应该考虑加入的另一种竞赛模式是完全没有玩家的模式：电脑与自己的对战。除了国际象棋游戏之外，很少有其他游戏采用这种模式；毕竟，人们玩电脑游戏是为了互动，而不是观看。不过，在体育游戏中，人们偶尔会喜欢让游戏自己玩，然后观看比赛结果，就像在电视上观看真正的比赛一样。这样做的另一个很好的理由是，可以让电脑进行玩家不想进行的模拟比赛。本章后面的“自动模拟比赛”一节将对此进行解释。

## Victory and Loss Conditions 胜利和失败条件

The victory and loss conditions for a match are the same as in the real sport. However, many sports played in leagues or by seasons can be simulated in a variety of game modes:

比赛的胜负条件与真实体育比赛中的胜负条件相同。不过，许多以联赛或赛季为单位进行的体育运动可以用多种游戏模式进行模拟：

* **Season mode.** The player selects a single team (or athlete, for individual sports such as skiing) from all those available and plays a series of matches throughout a season, trying to make it into the championships. The schedule of play for the season and the rules for moving into and up the championship bracket are adopted from the real sport. Some season modes allow a player to play not just one team's matches, but every single match played throughout an entire season.\

     **赛季模式。** 玩家从所有可用的运动项目中选择一支队伍（或一名运动员，如滑雪等单项运动），在整个赛季中进行一系列比赛，力争进入锦标赛。赛季的比赛日程和晋级规则均采用真实运动的规则。有些赛季模式不仅允许玩家参加一支球队的比赛，还允许玩家参加整个赛季的所有比赛。

* **Exhibition mode.** In this mode, the players play one single match, but it has no long-term consequences, just like exhibition matches played by real teams. Whoever wins the match, wins the game.\
    
    **表演赛模式。** 在这种模式下，玩家只进行一场比赛，但不产生长期影响，就像真实球队进行的表演赛一样。谁赢得了比赛，谁就赢得了比赛。

* **Sudden death.** As a variant of exhibition mode, players play a match only until the first score is made. Whoever makes the first score wins the match. This is handy for very quick games, although it means that luck plays a much greater role in determining the outcome.\

    **突然死亡。** 作为表演赛模式的一种变体，球员只进行一场比赛，直到取得第一分为止。谁先得分，谁就赢得比赛。这对于速度很快的比赛非常方便，但这意味着运气在决定比赛结果时起着更大的作用。

* **Round robin.** Players in a group each take a team and play each other's team a fixed number of times, sometimes just once. Whoever has won the most matches at the end is the winner.\

    **循环赛。** 一个小组中的球员各带一支队伍，与对方的队伍进行固定次数的比赛，有时只进行一次。最后谁赢得的比赛最多，谁就是赢家。

* **Tournament mode.** In this single-elimination tournament, any player who loses any match is dropped, and the winner goes on to play the winner of another match. This requires that the number of players be a power of two.\

    **锦标赛模式。** 在这种单场淘汰赛中，输掉任何一场比赛的玩家都会被淘汰，获胜者将与另一场比赛的获胜者对战。这要求玩家人数是 2 的幂。

* **Franchise mode.** The player controls a team over the course of several seasons, trying to build its strength through the years. This mode is often found in games that include mechanisms for hiring athletes and trading them among teams. For games such as tennis, in which most athletes play alone, the equivalent mode is called career mode—that is, the player controls the athlete over the course of several years of his or her career.\
    
    **特许经营模式。** 玩家在几个赛季中控制一支球队，试图通过几年的努力增强其实力。这种模式通常出现在包含运动员雇佣和球队间交易机制的游戏中。在网球等游戏中，大多数运动员都是单打独斗，因此相应的模式被称为职业生涯模式，即玩家控制运动员在其职业生涯的若干年中进行比赛。

## Setting 设置

The game's setting is the normal venue for the sport, usually a stadium or an arena. It adds a great deal of verisimilitude to present these accurately. Players enjoy being able to recognize the architectural details of their favorite stadiums. The shape of the actual playing areas in American football and basketball is fixed, but different baseball fields are famous for having different effects on gameplay. Some sports, such as skiing and bobsledding, have venues that vary enormously and require a great deal of practice to learn.

比赛场地是运动的正常场所，通常是体育场或竞技场。准确地呈现这些场馆能增加游戏的真实性。玩家喜欢能够辨认出他们喜爱的体育场馆的建筑细节。美式橄榄球和篮球的实际比赛场地的形状是固定的，但不同的棒球场地会对游戏产生不同的影响。有些运动，如滑雪和雪橇，其场地变化很大，需要大量练习才能掌握。

Outdoor fields are also subject to changes in the weather, which can significantly affect the game. Rain hampers traction on a grass field, and snow makes it worse still. Players have to run more slowly and carefully. Wind affects the flight of balls and the accuracy with which they can be thrown. These factors all add enjoyable variety to a game.

室外场地也会受到天气变化的影响，从而对比赛产生重大影响。下雨会影响草地的牵引力，而下雪则会使情况更糟。球员必须跑得更慢、更小心。风会影响球的飞行和投掷的准确性。这些因素都为比赛增添了乐趣。

The crowd also contributes significantly to the setting. Although you won't want to devote a lot of graphical resources to spectators, the sounds they make add greatly to the atmosphere. The volume should go up at tense moments. If there are any commonly used chants at different times, the players should hear them; there should be cheering after a score by the home team and a sudden silence after a score by the visitors. Horns, whistles, and vendors calling out "Ice-cold beer here!" are all part of the experience.

人群也对比赛环境有很大的影响。虽然你不想在观众身上投入大量的图形资源，但他们发出的声音会大大增加游戏的气氛。在紧张时刻，音量应该提高。如果在不同时刻有任何常用的喊声，球员们应该能听到；主队得分后应该有欢呼声，而客队得分后应该突然安静下来。喇叭声、口哨声和小贩叫卖声 “冰镇啤酒在这里！”都是体验的一部分。

## Interaction Model 互动模式

The interaction model in sports games varies considerably depending on the sport, but in most cases, the player is controlling an avatar who is one of the athletes in the match. In one-on-one sports such as tennis, this is straightforward, but in team sports, the player's control usually switches automatically from one athlete to another as the focus of play changes. In basketball games, for example, control normally switches to the athlete who has the ball. If the player's team is on defense, most games let the player choose which athlete to control and to switch quickly from one to another as conditions change. This often requires significant changes to the user interface as play progresses.

体育游戏中的互动模式因运动项目的不同而有很大差异，但在大多数情况下，玩家控制的是一个化身，而这个化身就是比赛中的一名运动员。在网球等一对一的运动中，这种模式很简单，但在团队运动中，玩家的控制权通常会随着比赛焦点的变化而自动从一名运动员切换到另一名运动员。例如，在篮球比赛中，控制权通常会转交给持球的运动员。如果玩家所在的球队正在防守，大多数游戏都会让玩家选择控制哪名运动员，并在情况发生变化时迅速从一名运动员切换到另一名运动员。这通常需要在游戏过程中对用户界面进行重大改动。

## Perspective 视角

In one-on-one sports games, the perspective is seldom difficult to manage. Choose a spot where you have a clear view of the athletes and where their movements and activities will map neatly onto the machine's input devices. As a general rule, you shouldn't do sports games in the first person. A lot of the fun of watching a sport is in seeing the athletes exercise their skills, and in first person, you can't see your avatar doing that. For example, you could make a tennis game in the first person, but you wouldn't get to see your athlete playing tennis, and you might not even get to see your racket hit the ball. An overhead perspective, with your tennis player at the bottom of the screen and your opponent at the top, presents a much more natural view and lets you see both athletes running, jumping, serving, and so on.

在一对一的体育游戏中，视角很少难以控制。选择一个你能清楚看到运动员的位置，他们的动作和活动也能清晰地映射到机器的输入设备上。一般来说，你不应该以第一人称进行体育游戏。观看体育比赛的很多乐趣在于看到运动员锻炼自己的技能，而在第一人称视角下，你无法看到你的化身在做这些。例如，你可以用第一人称来制作网球游戏，但你看不到你的运动员在打网球，甚至可能看不到你的球拍击球。采用俯视视角，你的网球运动员在屏幕下方，你的对手在屏幕上方，这样呈现的视角要自然得多，你可以看到双方运动员的奔跑、跳跃、发球等动作。

Team games are more tricky, particularly when the focus of attention moves from place to place. With most soccerlike games, an end view or a side view, from a somewhat elevated position, works best. American football, however, is almost unplayable from a side view because too many athletes are behind other athletes and you can't see gaps in the line.

团队游戏则比较棘手，尤其是当注意力从一个地方转移到另一个地方时。对于大多数类似足球的比赛，从稍高的位置看端线或侧线效果最好。而美式橄榄球从侧面看几乎无法进行比赛，因为太多运动员在其他运动员后面，你看不到队伍中的空隙。

## User Interface Design 用户界面设计

In most other genres, the user interface changes infrequently and only in response to explicit actions by the player. Sports games are unusual in this regard; the user interface changes on a second-by-second basis, depending on conditions in the match itself. American football is a particularly complex example. On each play, the player on offense selects the formation and play to be run, then calls signals and makes adjustments at the line of scrimmage, and then takes the snap and either hands off the ball, passes it, or runs with it himself. If he passes it, control switches to the athlete for whom the pass is intended, and a whole series of new options for running, jumping, diving, and dodging defenders comes into play. Each of these different states requires that certain moves or choices be assigned to buttons on the controller, and these assignments change rapidly as play progresses.

在大多数其他类型的游戏中，用户界面的变化并不频繁，而且只有在玩家做出明确操作后才会发生变化。体育游戏在这方面则不同寻常；用户界面每秒都在变化，这取决于比赛本身的情况。美式足球就是一个特别复杂的例子。在每场比赛中，进攻方球员要选择阵型和战术，然后呼叫信号并在争球线上做出调整，然后开球，要么交出球，要么传球，要么自己带球跑。如果他传球，控制权就会转到传球对象的运动员手中，一系列新的跑动、跳跃、俯冲和躲避防守的选择就会出现。每种不同的状态都要求将某些动作或选择分配给控制器上的按钮，而这些分配会随着游戏的进行而迅速变化。

The hardest thing about sports game user interface design is that you have to map athletic activities—complex motions of the whole human body—onto a game machine's input device, typically a handheld controller with binary buttons. Think about what kinds of things the player will want to do at each stage of the game and how best to make them available. Whenever possible, make sure that similar actions in different modes are assigned to similar buttons; for example, if you have a "jump" action in both offensive and defensive modes, assign it to the same button in both cases.

体育游戏用户界面设计的难点在于，你必须将体育活动--整个人体的复杂动作--映射到游戏机的输入设备上，通常是一个带有二进制按钮的手持控制器。想想玩家在游戏的每个阶段会想做哪些事情，以及如何最好地实现这些事情。在可能的情况下，确保将不同模式下的类似动作分配到相似的按钮上；例如，如果你在进攻和防守模式下都有 “跳跃 ”动作，那么在两种情况下都将其分配到相同的按钮上。

In team games, the player will normally be controlling one athlete at a time. This is usually indicated by displaying a circle or star under the athlete's feet. A good many games also draw symbols on the field to help the player overcome the lack of depth perception—the spot where a flying ball is due to land, for example.

在团队游戏中，球员通常一次控制一名运动员。这通常会在运动员脚下显示一个圆圈或星星。很多游戏还会在球场上画出一些符号，帮助玩家克服深度知觉不足的问题--例如，飞来的球将落在哪里。

When the player is on defense, include a button to automatically change control to the most appropriate defending athlete (in soccerlike games, this is usually the one nearest to the ball). Another useful pair of buttons allows the player to cycle control forward and backward through all the athletes on the team.

当玩家处于防守状态时，可通过一个按钮自动将控制权切换到最合适的防守运动员（在类似足球的游戏中，通常是离球最近的运动员）。另一对有用的按钮可以让玩家前后循环控制队中的所有运动员。

Most sports games avoid pull-down menus and anything else that resembles a computer's desktop, so as not to interfere with the fantasy. Pop-up windows and semitransparent overlays are common, particularly if they can be styled to look like the graphics seen on TV. These are subject to style variations from year to year. We suggest that you watch matches on TV for examples of how the overlay graphics are handled.

大多数体育游戏都避免使用下拉菜单和其他类似电脑桌面的东西，以免干扰玩家的幻想。弹出式窗口和半透明覆盖层很常见，特别是如果它们的样式可以看起来像电视上的画面。这些样式每年都会有所不同。我们建议你观看电视上的比赛，以了解如何处理叠加图形。

Unless you're simulating archery or bowling, don't forget that a sports game is essentially an action game. No matter how complex the sport is, the user interface must be as smooth and intuitive as you can make it.

除非是模拟射箭或保龄球，否则不要忘记体育游戏本质上就是动作游戏。无论这项运动有多复杂，用户界面都必须尽可能地流畅和直观。

## Player Roles

玩家角色

The player's role is most commonly that of an athlete, but not one particular athlete. In a team sport, the player's focus of control usually follows the action rather than being tied to a single individual. Thus, the player's role shifts rapidly, especially if some athletes play specialized positions such as catcher or goalie.

球员的角色最常见的是运动员，但不是某个运动员。在团队运动中，球员的控制重心通常是跟着动作走，而不是绑在某个人身上。因此，运动员的角色转换很快，尤其是当一些运动员担任专门的位置（如捕手或守门员）时。

Another common role is that of coach, again seen chiefly in team sports. The coach selects the starting players for the team, sets offensive and defensive strategies, and makes player substitutions during the match. The player usually switches to the coach role during timeouts or other pauses in the action.

另一个常见的角色是教练，同样主要出现在团队运动中。教练为球队挑选首发球员，制定进攻和防守策略，并在比赛中替换球员。球员通常在暂停或其他比赛暂停时转换为教练角色。

Finally, there's the role of general manager of the team. The general manager is respon sible for hiring and firing decisions and trying to recruit the best players within the limitations of the budget. See Figure 12.1 for an example. A few sports games are about only this aspect of the sport and don't include live simulations of the sport itself. These are occasionally called manager games and are particularly popular in Europe.

最后是球队总经理的角色。总经理负责做出聘用和解雇的决定，并努力在预算范围内招募最好的球员。示例见图 12.1。少数体育游戏只涉及体育运动的这一方面，而不包括体育运动本身的现场模拟。这些游戏有时被称为经理人游戏，在欧洲特别流

Figure 12.1. EA's Madden NFL 2002 athlete-trading screen, a management function. 图 12.1. EA 的《疯狂橄榄球 2002》（Madden NFL 2002）运动员交易屏幕，这是一种管理功能。

## Structure 结构

The structure of a sports game is typically simple. Its main play mode is match play, simulating the sport itself as it is played. You can usually pause the game and bring up a pause menu. While the game is paused, you can substitute athletes, change the camera view, adjust the AI if it can be adjusted, and perform other sorts of coaching tasks. You can also save the game for later or abandon it.

体育游戏的结构通常很简单。它的主要游戏模式是比赛，模拟运动本身的比赛过程。你通常可以暂停比赛并调出暂停菜单。在比赛暂停时，你可以替换运动员、改变摄像机视角、调整人工智能（如果可以调整的话）以及执行其他各种教练任务。你还可以保存比赛以备后用，或者放弃比赛。

Outside of match play, most of the game's modes relate to other aspects of the sport: studying the athletes' ratings and performance statistics, hiring and trading them, establishing a depth chart, and following the sport's playing schedule on a calendar. The screen layouts tend to reflect the bookkeeping nature of these activities, often resembling tables or graphs.

在比赛之外，游戏的大部分模式都与体育运动的其他方面有关：研究运动员的评级和表现统计、雇佣和交易运动员、建立深度表，以及在日历上关注运动的比赛日程。屏幕布局倾向于反映这些活动的记账性质，通常类似于表格或图表。
