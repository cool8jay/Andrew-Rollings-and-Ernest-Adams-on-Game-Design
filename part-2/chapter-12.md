Sports games set an unusual challenge for the game designer. Unlike most other games, which take place in a world the player knows little about, sports games emulate a world the player knows a lot about: sporting events as they are in real life. No one has ever really led an army of elves into combat, and only a small number of people know how it feels to fly an F-16 fighter jet, but a great many people know what professional football looks like and how the game is played. Sports games belong to a small number of genres that permit a direct comparison with the real world.

体育游戏给游戏设计者带来了不同寻常的挑战。与大多数其他游戏不同，这些游戏发生在玩家知之甚少的世界中，而体育游戏模拟了一个玩家非常了解的世界：现实生活中的体育赛事。没有人真正领导过一支精灵军队作战，只有少数人知道驾驶 F-16 战斗机是什么感觉，但很多人都知道职业橄榄球是什么样子，比赛是如何进行的。体育游戏属于少数可以与现实世界直接比较的游戏类型。

Not all sports games are ultrarealistic, of course. Some, such as Electronic Arts' old Genesis game [Mutant League Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_League_Football), are fantasy games, even if they are based on real sports. Others, such as Midway's arcade game [NFL Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Blitz), simplify a sport and deliberately make it more extreme for dramatic purposes. Most of these kinds of games are designed to appeal to kids, who might not know much about the real sport. But for aficionados, the game must be a reasonably accurate depiction of the real thing, and they will see any deviation as a flaw.

当然，并非所有的体育游戏都是超真实的。有些游戏，如 Electronic Arts 的旧版 Genesis 游戏[《变异联盟橄榄球》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_League_Football)，即使是基于真实体育运动的游戏，也是幻想游戏。还有一些游戏，如 Midway 的街机游戏[《NFL 闪电战》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Blitz)，则简化了某项运动，并故意使其更加极端，以达到戏剧化的目的。这类游戏大多是为了吸引儿童，因为他们可能对真正的体育运动知之甚少。但对于游戏爱好者来说，游戏必须相当准确地描述真实情况，任何偏差都会被他们视为缺陷。

This chapter discusses athletic sports, as opposed to sports such as motor racing. Although racing games are often sold in the sports category, from a design standpoint, they really belong in Chapter 13, "Vehicle Simulations."

本章讨论的是田径运动，而不是赛车等运动。虽然赛车游戏经常在体育类游戏中出售，但从设计的角度来看，它们真正属于[第十三章](/part-2/chapter-13.md)“驾驶工具模拟”。

> **A Note on Terminology 术语说明**
> 
> Because sports games simulate other games, as opposed to a war, a race, or an economic competition of some kind, the words player and game are ambiguous. Does player refer to the person playing the computer game or one of the athletes playing the game on the field? In this chapter, we use the following convention: Player refers to the person playing the computer game, as it does throughout the rest of the book. We call the people in the game athletes. Game refers to the computer game. When we refer to one particular contest, we call it a match. The type of match that the athletes are playing (basketball or soccer, for example) is called the sport.
> 
> 因为体育游戏模拟的是其他游戏，而不是战争、比赛或某种经济竞争，所以玩家和游戏这两个词很模糊。玩家指的是玩电脑游戏的人，还是在赛场上玩游戏的运动员？在本章中，我们采用以下惯例：玩家指的是玩电脑游戏的人，本书其他部分也是如此。我们称游戏中的人为运动员。游戏指的是电脑游戏。当我们提到某场比赛时，我们称之为比赛。运动员进行的比赛类型（例如篮球或足球）称为运动。
> 
> A great many sports involve a playing area with a goal at either end and athletes trying to manipulate some object into the goal. Basketball, ice hockey, water polo, and soccer are all examples. We refer to these collectively as soccerlike games.
> 
> 许多体育运动都有一个比赛场地，两端各有一个球门，运动员试图将某个物体射入球门。篮球、冰上曲棍球、水球和足球都是例子。我们将这些运动统称为类似足球的比赛。
