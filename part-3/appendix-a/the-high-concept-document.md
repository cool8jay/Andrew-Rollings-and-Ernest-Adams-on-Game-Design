# The High-Concept Document 高概念文档

A high-concept document is primarily a sales tool, although you can write one for yourself as well, just as a way of keeping a record of ideas you've had. Think of it as a résumé for a video game. The point of a résumé is to quickly convey a job applicant's qualifications and try to get him an interview with the hiring manager. The point of a high-concept document is to try to get a meeting with a producer, the chance to "pitch" the game. It should communicate rapidly and clearly the idea of the game—to whet her appetite and make her want to hear more about it. It doesn't matter that you haven't thought through all the details. You'll almost certainly end up changing several of the features during development anyway. The real point is to convey how much fun the game is going to be.

高概念文档主要是一种销售工具，不过你也可以为自己写一份，只是把你的想法记录下来。把它想象成电子游戏的简历。简历的意义在于快速传达求职者的资历，并为他争取到与招聘经理面谈的机会。而高概念文件的目的则是争取与制作人会面，获得“推介”游戏的机会。它应该快速、清晰地传达游戏的理念，吊起她的胃口，让她想听到更多关于游戏的信息。即使你没有考虑到所有细节也没关系。反正在开发过程中，你几乎肯定会改变其中的一些功能。真正的重点是要传达出游戏多么有趣。

A high-concept document should be two to four pages long and should take no more than 10 minutes to read. The longer it is, the less likely it is that the producer will finish reading it. It shouldn't have a title page; the title and your name appear at the top of the first page, and the text begins immediately. Its most important material must appear on the first page.

一份高概念文档应为两到四页，阅读时间不应超过 10 分钟。篇幅越长，制作人读完的可能性就越小。文件不应有扉页；标题和你的姓名应出现在第一页的顶部，然后立即开始正文。最重要的材料必须出现在第一页。

In the sections that follow, we describe the key elements of a high-concept document.

在接下来的章节中，我们将介绍高概念文档的关键要素。

## High-Concept Statement 高概念陈述

After the title and your name, the document should begin with no more than two lines that state the idea of the game. In a commercial environment, it is imperative that the idea be instantly comprehensible because everyone's most precious commodity is time. If the producer doesn't get the idea in a sentence or two, he's going to worry that the publisher's sales staff, the wholesale buyers, and, most important, the retail customers won't get it either.

在标题和您的姓名之后，文件的开头应该用不超过两行的文字说明游戏的创意。在商业环境中，创意必须一目了然，因为每个人最宝贵的就是时间。如果制作人不能在一两句话中理解游戏的创意，他就会担心出版商的销售人员、批发商以及最重要的零售客户也不会理解。

Of course, there are exceptions to this, and those exceptions are often some of the greatest and most innovative games. In Pac-Man, for example, the player is a circle that eats dots and fruit and is chased by ghosts in a maze—not exactly an obvious idea. However, Pac-Man is an arcade game, which means that people can actually watch it playing by itself before they commit their money. If you're going to propose something really strange for a retail game, you need to be very good at explaining it!

当然，也有例外，而这些例外往往是一些最伟大、最具创新性的游戏。例如，在[《吃豆人》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)中，玩家是一个吃点和水果的圆圈，在迷宫中被幽灵追赶--这并不是一个显而易见的想法。然而，[《吃豆人》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)是一款街机游戏，这意味着人们在掏钱之前，实际上可以看到它自己在玩。如果你要为零售游戏提出一个非常奇怪的想法，你就必须善于解释！

## Features 特点

The rest of the first page should be devoted to a bulleted list of the key features of the game. Each item should consist of two or three sentences, no more. Remember that unless you have included a concept drawing, your reader doesn't have a mental picture of the game, so this section needs to build one for him. It's much more important at this point to convey the game's look and feel than to give the details about how it works. You're not selling the game's internal economy or its AI; you're selling the player's experience.

第一页的其余部分应以列表形式列出游戏的主要特点。每项内容只需两三句话，不宜过多。请记住，除非您附上概念图，否则读者在脑海中并没有游戏的印象，因此这一部分需要为他建立一个印象。在这一点上，传达游戏的外观和感觉要比介绍游戏如何运行的细节重要得多。你不是在推销游戏的内部经济或人工智能，而是在推销玩家的体验。

Avoid letting the feature list run on to the next page, if you can. More than about 10 bullet points in a row starts to look like a mass of text to read and discourages the eye. You might want to put the items that you think are the most fun, the most innovative, or the most important in bold type, just as you would in a résumé.

如果可以的话，避免让功能列表排到下一页。连续超过 10 个要点会让人觉得阅读起来像一大堆文字，让人望而却步。您可能想把您认为最有趣、最新颖或最重要的项目用粗体字标出，就像在简历中一样。

## Overview 概述

In this section, beginning on the second page, you summarize the key commercial considerations about the game: what machine it's for, who would buy it and why, and what you're hoping that the game will achieve. Consider including any or all the following items:

在这一部分，从第二页开始，你将总结有关游戏的主要商业考虑因素：它适用于什么机 器，谁会购买它，为什么，以及你希望游戏达到什么目的。考虑包括以下任何或所有项目：

* Player motivation. This is a short statement that indicates what the player is trying to accomplish in the game—its victory condition. This helps indicate what sort of person the player is. He can be driven by a desire to compete, to solve puzzles, to explore, or whatever.\
玩家动机。这是一个简短的陈述，说明玩家在游戏中想要实现的目标--即胜利条件。这有助于说明玩家是什么样的人。他的动机可以是竞争、解谜、探索或其他。
* Genre. Indicate the genre of the game, or if it is a mix of genres, indicate that.\
类型。说明游戏的类型，如果是混合类型，则说明混合类型。
* License. If you intend for the game to exploit a licensed property, say so here. Also include any facts and figures about the property's popularity, recognition value, and appeal to particular markets—but no more than a sentence or two.\
许可证。如果你打算让游戏利用已获授权的财产，请在此处注明。此外，还请提供有关该特许权的受欢迎程度、认可价值以及对特定市场的吸引力的事实和数据--但不要超过一两句话。
* Target customer. What kind of person will buy this game? If age or sex is relevant, indicate that; more important, tell what other kinds of games they like to play.\
目标客户。什么样的人会购买这款游戏？如果与年龄或性别有关，请注明；更重要的是，要说明他们还喜欢玩什么类型的游戏。
* Competition. Are there already games on the market like this one? If so, list their names and indicate how this one is different or better than they are. This section isn't absolutely necessary, but it can reassure your reader that your game isn't just a copy of something else.\
竞争。市场上是否已经有类似的游戏？如果有，请列出它们的名称，并说明这款游戏与它们有何不同或更好。这一部分并非绝对必要，但可以让读者放心，你的游戏并非只是其他游戏的翻版。
* Unique selling points. What's new in this game? How will it stand out from what has gone before?\
独特卖点。 这款游戏有何新意？它将如何从以往的游戏中脱颖而出？
* Target hardware. Tell what machine the game is intended for. Also indicate whether the game requires or can make optional use of any special hardware or accessories.\
目标硬件。说明游戏适用的机器。还要说明游戏是否需要或可以选择使用任何特殊硬件或配件。
* Design goals. In this section, list your aims for the game as an experience. Don't just say "fun"—that's too broad. Be more specific. Are you trying to provide pulse-pounding excitement? Tension and suspense? Strategic challenge? Humor? A heartwarming story? The ability to construct or create something of the player's own? For each item, indicate in a sentence or two how the game will achieve the goal.\
设计目标。在这一部分，列出你对游戏体验的目标。不要只说 “好玩”--那太笼统了。要更加具体。你是否想提供令人心跳加速的刺激感？紧张和悬念？战略挑战？幽默？感人肺腑的故事？构建或创造属于玩家自己的东西的能力？对于每一项，请用一两句话说明游戏将如何实现目标。

## Further Details 更多详情

In the last section, you can include additional material that you think the reader will enjoy learning about the game. You might include notes about the characters, the artwork, the music, the plot, or anything else that might pique his interest. Don't add so much that it makes the document too long, however.

在最后一部分，你可以加入一些你认为读者会喜欢的关于游戏的补充材料。 你可以加入有关角色、艺术品、音乐、情节或其他任何可能引起读者兴趣的内容。但不要添加太多，以免文档太长。

> **Features 特点**
> 
> * The point of view is derived from fighting games, with large, detailed players.
> 该视角源自格斗游戏，玩家人数众多，细节丰富。
> * You choose teams just like in real sandlot football, taking turns picking players from the neighborhood crowd. Each person has a different look, attributes, and set of skills. Not all the kids are available all the time.
> 你可以像真正的沙地足球一样选择球队，轮流从附近的人群中挑选球员。每个人都有不同的外表、属性和技能。并不是所有的孩子都能一直踢球。
> * The "field" is an urban alley about 50 yards long. Sidewalks are out of bounds. Garbage cans, potholes, and junked cars create additional obstacles. Tin cans mark the yard lines.
> 球场 "是一条长约 50 码的城市小巷。人行道是禁区。垃圾桶、坑坑洼洼的路面和破旧的汽车都是额外的障碍。铁罐标出了码线。
> * As in a fighting game, it's the personal interactions that count. Dodging, ducking, faking, jumping, diving, and tackling are all essential parts of the game. Certain players have special moves or abilities.
> 和格斗游戏一样，人与人之间的互动才是最重要的。躲闪、闪避、假动作、跳跃、俯冲和擒抱都是游戏的重要组成部分。某些玩家拥有特殊的动作或能力。
> * Five pass plays, five running plays, and the field goal make up the whole playbook. Field goals and extra points are kicked through two guys holding their arms out and up like goalposts.
> 五种传球战术、五种跑动战术和射门得分构成了整个战术手册。射门得分和加分是通过两个人像门柱一样伸出手臂踢出的。
> * Health meters show the players' level of injury and fatigue. If you lose a player, you can pick another one, but you forfeit two touchdowns.
> 健康指数显示球员的受伤和疲劳程度。如果你失去了一名球员，你可以再选一名，但你要放弃两次达阵。
> * Rules are adapted for street football: You have four downs to get into your opponent's territory, and four more downs to score. Otherwise, you turn over the ball—no punting. No penalties except offsides, but expect a fistfight if it gets too rough.
> 规则是根据街头足球改编的： 你有四次进攻机会进入对手的领地，再有四次进攻机会得分。否则，你就翻球，不能罚球。除越位外没有罚球，但如果太粗暴就会发生拳击。
> * Lots of comedy touches: ball breaks a window—player flies into garbage can—player slips and skids on oil slick—van drives down alley and flattens football—little kid rides tricycle across the field—rival gangs appear and tag buildings, and then disappear—nerdy bystander gets called home to supper.
> 很多喜剧元素：球打破窗户--球员飞进垃圾桶--球员滑倒在浮油上--货车开进小巷，压扁了足球--小孩子骑着三轮车穿过球场--敌对帮派出现，标记建筑物，然后消失--可爱的旁观者被叫回家吃晚饭。

> **Characters 角色**
> 
> Each of the characters has certain attributes that define how well he or she plays, and each player also has a relationship with the others in the group. Characters who are not playing can be seen watching from the sidelines, and the observant player will notice things going on that give hints about them. Here are a few possible characters:
> 
> 每个角色都有一定的属性，这些属性决定了他或她的发挥，每个玩家还与组中的其他玩家有一定的关系。不参加比赛的角色可以在场边观看，善于观察的玩家会注意到一些事情，从而得到关于他们的提示。以下是几个可能的角色：
> 
> *Joey:* All-American guy, a natural quarterback. Great passing accuracy, good scrambling, good pass distance, very good speed. Not a great receiver or blocker. Good stamina.
> 
> *乔伊：* 全美最佳球员，天生的四分卫。传球准确度高，争球能力强，传球距离远，速度快。不擅长接球或挡拆。耐力不错。
> 
> *Butch:* The bruiser on the block. Big and strong, hard to tackle, but slow. Great pass distance, but poor accuracy. A fair receiver. Excellent stamina. A loner, he usually stands by himself—he's not especially good with any other player.
> 
> *巴奇：* 挡拆中的悍将。高大强壮，难以擒抱，但速度较慢。传球距离远，但准确性差。一个不错的接球手。耐力出色。他是个独行侠，通常一个人独来独往，不善于与其他球员合作。 
> 
> *Dana:* She's lithe and agile, a good scrambler, and the fastest runner of the bunch. A good receiver and a fairly accurate passer, but her range is short. Fair stamina. Dana is Joey's girlfriend and stands with her arm around him, so they make a good team.
> 
> *达娜：* 她体态轻盈、动作敏捷，是一名优秀的抢断手，也是跑得最快的球员。她是一名优秀的接球手，传球相当准确，但射程较短。耐力尚可。丹娜是乔伊的女朋友，搂着他站在一起，所以他们是很好的搭档。
