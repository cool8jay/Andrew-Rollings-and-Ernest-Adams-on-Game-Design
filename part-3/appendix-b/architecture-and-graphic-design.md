# Architecture and Graphic Design

Not being artists or graphic designers ourselves, we don't have an extensive list of suggestions; but we have found the following useful or inspiring:

我们自己既不是艺术家也不是平面设计师，因此没有广泛的建议清单；但我们发现以下书籍很有用或很有启发性：

A Pattern Language. Alexander, Christopher, et al. Oxford University Press; ISBN: 0195019199. This work created something of a revolution in architectural theory when it appeared, adopting a practical/psychological approach to the way people use buildings. Some of its ideas formed the basis for The Sims.

The Grammar of Ornament. Jones, Owen. Various editions exist, including one on CD-ROM. A massive collection of decorative elements.

L'Ornement Polychrome. Racinet, Albert. Various editions. Another massive collection of decorative elements. Don't worry about the fact that it's in French—just look at the pictures.

The next three books comprise a series and should be read in this order. Don't be put off by the long-winded titles. They are invaluable tools for learning to express numeric quantities visually, something every game designer must do:

The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Tufte, Edward; Graphics Press; ISBN: 0961392142.

Envisioning Information. Tufte, Edward; Graphics Press; ISBN: 0961392118.

Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative. Tufte, Edward; Graphics Press; ISBN: 0961392126.
