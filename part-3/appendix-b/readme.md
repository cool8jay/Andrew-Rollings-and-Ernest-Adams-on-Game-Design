# Appendix B. Bibliography 附录B 参考书目

Now that you've read our book on game design, you might want to look into some others as well. Here we offer an eclectic selection of works for further reading. Some of them are specifically about games, but most are about other subjects that we believe a game designer should know something about; books that complement this one. We have not tried to be comprehensive, but rather to include works we have personally found to be useful.

既然你已经阅读了我们的游戏设计书籍，那么你可能还想了解一下其他书籍。在这里，我们提供了一些不拘一格的作品，供你进一步阅读。其中有些是专门关于游戏的，但大多数是关于我们认为游戏设计师应该了解的其他主题的，是对这本书的补充。我们并没有试图做到面面俱到，而是将我们个人认为有用的作品收录其中。
