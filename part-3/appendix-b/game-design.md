# Game Design

There aren't a great many other books on game design (that's part of why we wrote this one), but we think some of the following offer useful perspectives:

Art of Computer Game Design, The. Crawford, Chris. Probably the first book in the field, and a classic. This book is no longer in print, but may be read online at http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Coverpage.html. Crawford will also soon be publishing a new work, Chris Crawford on Game Design (Â©2004, New Riders Publishing), to which we look forward with interest.

Creating Emotion in Games: The Art and Craft of Emotioneering. Freeman, David; New Riders Publishing; ISBN: 1592730078 (due out Fall 2003).

Community Building on the Web: Secret Strategies for Successful Online Communities. Kim, Amy Jo; Peachpit Press. Although this isn't technically a game design book, it is a highly regarded work on online communities and should be considered required reading for anyone who wants to build an online game or persistent world.

Elements of User Experience, The. Garrett, Jesse James; New Riders Publishing; ISBN: 0735712026.

Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software. Johnson, Steve; Scribner; ISBN: 068486875X.

Game Architecture and Design. Rollings, Andrew and Dave Morris. Originally published by The Coriolis Group and soon to be reissued by New Riders. A giant tome on designing and building computer and video games from start to finish. It is the companion volume to this one.

Game Design Perspectives. Laramee, Francois Dominic (editor); Charles River Media; ISBN: 1584500905. This is an extensive collection of essays by a variety of people on different topics, not all of them game design.

Game Design Secrets of the Sages. Saltzman, Marc (editor); Brady Games. A collection of interviews with some of the top people in the business. In this form, it's more useful as background reading than how-to material, but it's a good way to see inside the heads of some of the industry's best designers.

Game Design: The Art & Business of Creating Games. Bates, Bob; Premier Press; ISBN: 0761531653. More of an introduction to the entire game business than a game design book. It's easy to read and nicely illustrated, and Bob Bates' credentials are impeccable.

Swords & Circuitry: A Designer's Guide to Computer Role-Playing Games. Hallford, Neal and Jana Hallford; Premier Press; ISBN: 0761532994.
