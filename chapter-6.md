A game is more than just the sum of its rules. It must inter-act with the players to immerse them in the game world. To do this, it must project an aura of involvement that promotes Samuel Coleridge's "willing suspension of disbelief." Every element that the players' experience must contribute to the whole. From the moment the player loads the software and the first screen appears, he is in your world. Everything that he sees, hears, and feels from that point on—every audio, visual, and interactive element—must strive to convince him that the only thing that exists is the game. This is not the easiest of goals to achieve; any slight discord can jar the players out of their illusion. However, the best games generally achieve this level of perfection, or close to it, and the aim of this chapter is to discuss how you can attempt to account for deep player immersion in your designs.

游戏不仅仅是规则的总和。它必须与玩家互动，让玩家沉浸在游戏世界中。要做到这一点，游戏必须营造出一种参与的氛围，促进萨缪尔·柯勒律治的“心甘情愿地终止怀疑”。玩家体验的每一个元素都必须对整体有所贡献。从玩家加载软件和第一个屏幕出现的那一刻起，他就进入了你的世界。从那时起，他所看到、听到和感受到的一切，包括音频、视频和互动元素，都必须努力让他相信，唯一存在的就是游戏。这并不是最容易实现的目标；任何轻微的不和谐都会让玩家从幻觉中惊醒。然而，最好的游戏一般都能达到或接近这种完美的程度，本章的目的就是要讨论如何在你的设计中尝试让玩家深度沉浸其中。

This chapter discusses some of the most relevant aspects of user experience design (and note that by user experience, we're talking about the whole thing: audio, visual, and interaction methods) for games. Even though we have stressed the relative importance of flashy presentation as secondary to gameplay, we would be foolish to discard presentation entirely. The user interface is the first real glimpse the players will get of your game in action; it's your first chance to suck them into the world presented by your game.

本章将讨论与游戏用户体验设计（注意，我们所说的用户体验是指整个用户体验：音频、视觉和交互方法）最相关的一些方面。尽管我们已经强调华丽的表现形式相对于游戏性而言处于次要地位，但如果我们完全抛弃表现形式，那就太愚蠢了。用户界面是玩家真正了解游戏的第一印象，也是将玩家带入游戏世界的第一次机会。

The user interface can make or break your game: It can give it the perfect air of consummate professionalism or the shabby appearance of an amateur effort. Although we would prefer to believe that the gameplay is the most important factor in the success of a game, the majority of commercial evidence seems to indicate otherwise. With few exceptions, two games that are functionally equivalent, with equally effective marketing and differing only in the quality of their user interface layers, will not perform equally in the market. It would be tempting to say that the game with the most visually and technically stunning user interface would sell better—and we know that would please a lot of developers and artists out there—but, all things being equal, that is not the case. In fact, given these two functionally equivalent products, the one with the interface that is most fit for the purpose will be the most successful. (Of course, you can publish all manner of tripe if you have a big name license attached to it. Some things will never change.)

用户界面可以决定游戏的成败： 它可以使游戏具有完美的专业水准，也可以使游戏看起来像业余爱好者的拙劣作品。尽管我们更愿意相信游戏的玩法是游戏成功的最重要因素，但大多数商业证据似乎表明并非如此。除了极少数例外情况，两款功能相当、营销效果相当、仅在用户界面层质量上存在差异的游戏，在市场上的表现并不相同。我们很容易说，用户界面视觉效果和技术含量最高的游戏会卖得更好--我们知道这会让很多开发者和艺术家感到满意--但在所有条件都相同的情况下，事实并非如此。事实上，在这两种功能相当的产品中，界面最符合目的的产品将是最成功的。(当然，只要有大牌授权，你就可以出版各种垃圾产品。有些东西永远不会改变）。
