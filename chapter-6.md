A game is more than just the sum of its rules. It must inter-act with the players to immerse them in the game world. To do this, it must project an aura of involvement that promotes Samuel Coleridge's "willing suspension of disbelief." Every element that the players' experience must contribute to the whole. From the moment the player loads the software and the first screen appears, he is in your world. Everything that he sees, hears, and feels from that point on—every audio, visual, and interactive element—must strive to convince him that the only thing that exists is the game. This is not the easiest of goals to achieve; any slight discord can jar the players out of their illusion. However, the best games generally achieve this level of perfection, or close to it, and the aim of this chapter is to discuss how you can attempt to account for deep player immersion in your designs.

游戏不仅仅是规则的总和。它必须与玩家互动，让玩家沉浸在游戏世界中。要做到这一点，游戏必须营造出一种参与的氛围，促进萨缪尔·柯勒律治的“心甘情愿地终止怀疑”。玩家体验的每一个元素都必须对整体有所贡献。从玩家加载软件和第一个屏幕出现的那一刻起，他就进入了你的世界。从那时起，他所看到、听到和感受到的一切，包括音频、视频和互动元素，都必须努力让他相信，唯一存在的就是游戏。这并不是最容易实现的目标；任何轻微的不和谐都会让玩家从幻觉中惊醒。然而，最好的游戏一般都能达到或接近这种完美的程度，本章的目的就是要讨论如何在你的设计中尝试让玩家深度沉浸其中。

This chapter discusses some of the most relevant aspects of user experience design (and note that by user experience, we're talking about the whole thing: audio, visual, and interaction methods) for games. Even though we have stressed the relative importance of flashy presentation as secondary to gameplay, we would be foolish to discard presentation entirely. The user interface is the first real glimpse the players will get of your game in action; it's your first chance to suck them into the world presented by your game.

本章将讨论与游戏用户体验设计（注意，我们所说的用户体验是指整个用户体验：音频、视觉和交互方法）最相关的一些方面。尽管我们已经强调华丽的外观相对于游戏性而言处于次要地位，但如果我们完全抛弃外观，那就太愚蠢了。用户界面是玩家真正了解游戏的第一印象，也是将玩家带入游戏世界的第一次机会。

The user interface can make or break your game: It can give it the perfect air of consummate professionalism or the shabby appearance of an amateur effort. Although we would prefer to believe that the gameplay is the most important factor in the success of a game, the majority of commercial evidence seems to indicate otherwise. With few exceptions, two games that are functionally equivalent, with equally effective marketing and differing only in the quality of their user interface layers, will not perform equally in the market. It would be tempting to say that the game with the most visually and technically stunning user interface would sell better—and we know that would please a lot of developers and artists out there—but, all things being equal, that is not the case. In fact, given these two functionally equivalent products, the one with the interface that is most fit for the purpose will be the most successful. (Of course, you can publish all manner of tripe if you have a big name license attached to it. Some things will never change.)

用户界面可以决定游戏的成败：它可以使游戏具有完美的专业水准，也可以使游戏看起来像业余爱好者的拙劣作品。尽管我们更愿意相信游戏的玩法是游戏成功的最重要因素，但大多数商业证据似乎表明并非如此。除了极少数例外情况，两款功能相当、营销效果相当、仅在用户界面层质量上存在差异的游戏，在市场上的表现并不相同。我们很容易说，用户界面视觉效果和技术含量最高的游戏会卖得更好——我们知道这会让很多开发者和艺术家感到满意——但在所有条件都相同的情况下，事实并非如此。事实上，在这两种功能相当的产品中，界面最符合目的的产品将是最成功的。(当然，只要有大牌授权，你就可以发布各种垃圾产品。有些东西永远不会改变）。

# What Is the User Experience? 什么是用户体验？

User experience: The term sounds suspiciously like a couple of strung-together buzzwords you'd expect to see on poor advertising copy. Obviously, that's an impression we'd rather dispel as quickly as possible, so let's attempt to "debuzzify" the term by describing exactly what we mean.

用户体验：这个术语听起来非常像是那种你在糟糕的广告文案中期望看到的一串流行术语的组合。显然，我们希望尽快消除这种印象，因此，让我们尝试通过描述我们的确切含义来“去流行化”这个术语。

We define the user experience as the total package presented to the player when she plays the game. It is the combination of three distinct areas of the design—the visual element, the audio element, and the interactive element—and is concerned with their impact on the user interface. The following sections give a brief précis of what we'll be covering in more detail.

我们将用户体验定义为玩家在玩游戏时所获得的整体体验。它是设计的三个不同领域——视觉元素、听觉元素和交互元素——的组合，并关注它们对用户界面的影响。以下章节简要介绍了我们将要详细介绍的内容。

## The Interactive Element 交互元素

The interactive part of the user experience is concerned with the way the player interacts with the game. This is tied in closely with the visual aspect but is more concerned with the "feel" part of "the look and feel." Here, we are concerned with the functional aspects of the user interface—the navigational pathways through the system—and the physical controller setup. How the interface looks is considered only as far as it affects the usability.

用户体验的互动部分涉及玩家与游戏的互动方式。这与视觉方面密切相关，但更关注“外观和感觉”中的 “感觉”部分。在这里，我们关注的是用户界面的功能方面——系统导航路径和物理控制器设置。界面的外观只有在影响可用性时才会被考虑。

## The Visual Element 视觉元素

The visual element concerns the "look" part of the "look and feel." Here, we consider the overall impact of the artwork and how it meshes and combines to present an overall consistent picture to the player. This is closely related to the interactive experience—one has a direct influence on the other—but we will attempt to discuss the areas separately and explain where there is crossover between the two.

视觉元素涉及“外观和感觉”中的“外观”部分。在这里，我们考虑美术作品的整体影响，以及它们如何相互融合，为玩家呈现出一个整体一致的画面。这与互动体验密切相关——一个直接影响另一个——但我们将尝试分别讨论这些领域，并解释二者之间的交叉点。

## The Audio Element 听觉元素

Often, the audio parts of a game are not considered in as much depth as the visual "in-your-face" areas of the game. However, audio is just as important for both atmosphere and player feedback as the visual components. Even though sound is often in third place after the visual and interactive elements, the fact that many games are unplayable without it clearly indicates the importance of sound. (Although, strictly speaking, no game should be designed that necessitates sound. That unfairly discriminates against the hearing impaired.)

通常情况下，人们对游戏声音部分的考虑不如对游戏“直观”部分的考虑那么深入。然而，声音对于游戏氛围和玩家反馈的作用与视觉部分同样重要。尽管声音往往排在视觉和互动元素之后，但许多游戏没有声音就无法玩下去，这清楚地表明了声音的重要性。(不过，严格来说，任何游戏的设计都不应该非要有声音不可。这是对听障人士的不公平歧视）。

# The Human-Computer Interface 人机接口

Designing a good user interface is not about how beautiful and whizzy you can make your buttons. In fact, the core essence of the user experience—enabling the player to interact with the game world—doesn't need any fancy graphics or sound. The functionality that allows a player to interact with the game effectively could theoretically be implemented using simple placeholder elements. In fact, while the interface is being designed, this is the recommended approach—it's faster, and more resource-efficient.

设计一个好的用户界面，并不在于你能把按钮做得多么漂亮、多么炫目。事实上，用户体验的核心本质——让玩家与游戏世界互动——并不需要任何华丽的图形或声音。理论上，只需使用简单的占位元素就能实现让玩家与游戏有效互动的功能。事实上，在设计界面时，我们推荐使用这种方法——它更快，也更节省资源。

As you may have already realized, we place more importance on the functional aspects of the user interface over the purely aesthetic aspects. Although we could argue that a perfectly functional user interface has a certain aesthetic appeal, we will not limit ourselves to this in our discussion. We would be foolish to completely disregard the aesthetic requirements—eye candy sells and certainly provides a more enjoyable, immersive experience—but they should be secondary to the functional aspects.

你可能已经意识到，我们更重视用户界面的功能性，而不是纯粹的美观性。虽然我们可以说，功能完善的用户界面也有一定的美感，但我们的讨论并不局限于此。如果我们完全无视美学方面的要求，那就太愚蠢了——眼球广告固然有卖点，固然能带来更愉悦、更身临其境的体验，但与功能方面相比，美学方面的要求应该是次要的。

> "When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I only think about how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong."
> “当我研究一个问题时，我从不考虑美。我只考虑如何解决问题。但当我完成之后，如果解决方案不美，我就知道它是错的。”
> 
> —Buckminster Fuller, 1895-1983
> ——巴克敏斯特·富勒，1895-1983

The functionality of the user interface is the most important consideration. After all, what player is going to take the time to play a beautiful game if she can't figure out which exquisitely detailed picture is the button to start the game? Conversely, even with the most efficient user interface, few people will bother with the game if it's as ugly as sin.

用户界面的功能性是最重要的考虑因素。毕竟，如果玩家不知道哪张精致细腻的图片是启动游戏的按钮，又有哪个玩家会花时间去玩一款精美的游戏呢？反过来说，即使是最有效的用户界面，如果丑陋不堪，也很少有人会去玩这款游戏。

Consequently, the discussions in this chapter take on a dual aspect: First, and most important in our view, we will concentrate on the functionality of the user interface. After we have discussed the functional aspects, we will concentrate on the aesthetics, paying particular attention to making sure that the aesthetics do not impact the functionality. Note that pure physical beauty is not the primary meaning of aesthetics for a user interface. Fitness for purpose is a far more important aesthetic consideration. This doesn't necessarily exclude having a beautiful interface, but we do insist that there should be more to the beauty than mere appearances. A butterfly may be prettier than a rubber life raft, but which would you rather have with you on a stormy sea?

因此，本章的讨论具有双重意义：首先，也是我们认为最重要的一点，我们将集中讨论用户界面的功能。在讨论了功能方面的问题后，我们将集中讨论美观方面的问题，尤其要注意确保美观不会影响功能。请注意，纯粹的外形美并不是用户界面美学的主要含义。更重要的美学考虑因素是是否适合使用。这并不一定排除界面美观的可能性，但我们坚持认为，美观不应该仅仅停留在表面。蝴蝶可能比橡胶救生筏更漂亮，但在惊涛骇浪中，你更愿意选择哪一个呢？

## Evolution of the User Experience 用户体验的进化

In order to set a context for the discussion in this chapter, it will be worth our while to take a brief look at how the user experience has progressed over the last 20 or so years.

为了给本章的讨论提供一个背景，我们不妨简要回顾一下用户体验在过去 20 多年中的发展历程。

Twenty years ago, each game had a different interface, although usually there was some influence from other sources—console games, arcade games, and other games in the same genre. It wasn't until the advent of the windowed operating systems that any form of homogeny was achieved. Nowadays, we don't even think twice before using the mouse to navigate and clicking the mouse button to press an onscreen button. It's a de facto standard now (on the PC at any rate), but it used to be a novelty.

20 年前，每款游戏都有不同的界面，尽管通常会受到其他游戏来源--控制台游戏、街机游戏和其他同类型游戏--的一些影响。直到窗口操作系统的出现，才实现了任何形式的同质化。如今，我们在使用鼠标导航和点击鼠标键按下屏幕上的按钮之前，甚至都不会多想。现在，这已经成为一种事实上的标准（无论如何，在个人电脑上），但在过去，这只是一种新鲜事物。

### Arcade Games 街机游戏

Initially, the game interface was simple. For arcade-style games, there would be a title screen with instructions (usually limited to a simple explanation of the controls) or a simple attract mode that cycled between two or three screens (title, instructions, and a high-score table). The game would remain in this state until the player pressed the Start button.

最初，游戏界面非常简单。对于街机类型的游戏，会有一个带说明的标题屏幕（通常仅限于简单的控制说明）或一个简单的吸引模式，在两个或三个屏幕（标题、说明和高分表）之间循环。游戏会一直保持这种状态，直到玩家按下“开始”按钮。

This soon evolved to include a fourth screen: the demo mode. For a small length of time (usually 30 seconds or so), a sequence was shown from the game in play, implemented either as a slide show of screens from various levels or as one of a selection of short snippets of gameplay.

这种模式很快发展到第四个屏幕：演示模式。在一段较短的时间内（通常为 30 秒左右），游戏会以不同关卡画面的幻灯片或精选的游戏片段的形式播放。

Once the game was started, the in-game interface was usually very simple (see Figure 6.1). The playing area would take up most of the screen. There would be a score display, a high-score display, a level display (if appropriate), and a "lives remaining" display. These would be placed at the top or bottom of the screen. And for many years, that was about the extent of the arcade game interface. Of course, there were subtle variations on this theme—for example, a power level meter in addition to or instead of a "lives remaining" display, and the odd bit of pertinent information specific to the game, such as "number of lines" in Tetris.

游戏开始后，游戏界面通常非常简单（见图 6.1）。游戏区域将占据屏幕的大部分。屏幕上会有分数显示、高分显示、关卡显示（如果合适）和“剩余生命”显示。这些都会放在屏幕的顶部或底部。多年来，这就是街机游戏界面的全部内容。当然，这个主题也有一些微妙的变化，例如，除了“剩余生命”显示外，还有一个电量表，以及一些游戏特有的相关信息，如俄罗斯方块中的“行数”。

Figure 6.1. The standard arcade game interface (Pac-Man Plus).

Williams's Defender (shown in Figure 6.2) was arguably the first game to enhance this core interface by adding a minimap; it was one of the first games with a playing area larger than the visible screen.

Figure 6.2. Williams's Defender.

graphics/06fig02.gif

Without waxing too lyrically about the nostalgia value of this proto-interface, it has to be said that there was a certain purity of purpose present. All the information that the player needed to be able to play the game was there at a glance. Of course, it wasn't that difficult to achieve, either; the limitations of the format pretty much dictated that the games be fairly simple. Any homogeny of interface was the result of the fact that there were only a few sensible ways of displaying the same information. The real progress occurred when the player needed to be fed too much information to be displayed on the screen at once.

Most arcade games are simple enough to be able to present all the necessary information on a single screen, and it's just as well that this is the case, because switching to an information screen in the middle of a fast-paced game is not a recipe for success. For those wanting to investigate some of these classic arcade games further, the MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) web site, www.mame.net, is a good starting point.

Consider an example of interface evolution: the humble golf game. Presumably, you are familiar with the basics of golf: Take a stick, go for a walk, and hit a small ball toward a marginally larger hole with as much force as you possibly can. As enjoyable as that sounds, a good number of developers have injected even more fun into the sport by allowing you to simulate it while not moving from the front of your computer. Of course, golf has an element of skill in the aiming and timing of the swing. Walking from hole to hole is also an important part of real golf (socially speaking, anyway), but this would not translate well as a fun gameplay feature, and so it is usually skipped. Hence, it's a logical assumption that game designers made the actual swinging at and hitting of the ball the main focus of the game.

In fact, taking a look at the rough lineage of golf games, it can be seen that this interface was perfected early on (around the time of the original Leaderboard golf game, shown in Figure 6.3) and has only had minor tweaks since then, ignoring the odd short-lived "revolution" that has occurred in the meantime. The first button click started the power meter rising, the second button click set the power (whereupon the meter indicator would begin to fall), and the third determined the accuracy of the shot; it had to be clicked when the indicator returned to the starting position. Getting it exactly right resulted in a perfect shot. Apart from the switch from keyboard to mouse or trackball, there has been very little modification to this system; it's the perfect interface for the golf game and has been relied upon since then. Even fairly recent games, such as the latest effort in the Links series of games, have stuck to this basic mechanic for gameplay. Even Golden Tee, the latest in a long series of golf games, uses a trackball-based evolution of this original interface.

This demonstrates an important point: Aside from the occasional flash of brilliance, the general progression of game interfaces has been an evolutionary, not revolutionary, one.

### Adventure Games 冒险游戏

Traditionally, adventure games were text-based. The player interacts with the system by reading a textual description of the location, and performing queries and actions based on that description.

The first adventures took their input in a "verb-noun" format. That is, "Take Food" would work, whereas "Take the Food on the Table" would be rejected. Movement commands generally took the single-word form—Up, Down, North, East, South, West—and could be abbreviated to U, D, N, E, S, W, NW, NE, and so on.

Adventure games used to be a popular and lucrative section of the games market. Over time, the sophistication of the parser allowed improvements in the nature of sentences usable with the games, and the quality of the writing correspondingly improved with the increasing capabilities of the target machines. Games such as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy from Infocom (publishers of the original Zork series of games) and Fish! from Magnetic Scrolls are good examples. For the curious, a Java version of The Hitchhiker's Guide is available to play at Douglasadams.com (www.douglasadams.com/creations/infocomjava.html).

Eventually, simple graphics appeared to help enliven the textual description. This improved the atmosphere to a degree, but also coincided with a general decrease in the quality of the writing. The designers relied more on the graphics (it's easier to draw a good picture than to craft good text) to tell the story, and the writing suffered correspondingly. The graphics tended to be presented in one of two forms: as either a full-screen image that was displayed briefly on entering a new location before clearing to allow the text to be displayed, or as a split-screen style, occupying a portion of the screen (usually the top half).

Apart from general improvements to the parser, which is indirectly related to the quality of the game interface, this was the pinnacle of the adventure game interface. Today, text adventure games are not commercially viable, but they do live on in the form of MUDs (multiuser dungeons) and MUSHs (multiuser shared hallucinations). For those wanting to investigate MUDs and MUSHs further, a good place to begin is www.mudcenter.com.

### Graphic Adventures 图形冒险

Graphic adventures are the spiritual successor to text adventures. Taking the maxim "a picture is worth a thousand words" as their rallying cry, designers began to take advantage of the increasing power of computers to create a fully graphical interface to the standard adventure game.

In many ways, this was unfortunate. We may lament the degradation of standards from the classic adventure game—similar to the preference of a significant portion of today's youth for watching cartoons over reading a good book—but we cannot argue with progress. Simply put, text adventures that required the player to type in their commands did not appeal to the consumer in the same way as a graphic adventure, which is, in effect, an interactive cartoon.

That aside, the point-and-click interface of the graphic adventure has changed very little over the years since the first appearance of the genre. From the earliest Leisure Suit Larry games (shown in Figure 6.4) through the latest in the Monkey Island series (shown in Figure 6.5), the interface has remained pleasingly consistent. The interface to a graphic adventure is a fairly simple construct. Most graphic adventures are 2D or pseudo-3D (that is, they use 3D graphics in a 2D scene-oriented fashion, rather like a stage show), and consequently, only a relatively simple game interface is required.

Figure 6.4. Leisure Suit Larry II.

graphics/06fig04.jpg

Figure 6.5. Escape from Monkey Island.

graphics/06fig05.gif

There are two main paradigms for the interface that are currently in use. The first is the split-screen text- or icon-based interface, where the player selects actions in the selection area of the screen and watches the results in the results portion of the screen. An example of a game that uses this format is LucasArts's Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle, shown in Figure 6.6.

Figure 6.6. Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle.

graphics/06fig06.gif

The second paradigm, used by such games as Myst (shown in Figure 6.7), uses the whole screen as the interface. The player moves the cursor around the screen and clicks on objects or characters of interest. In this way, the story is visually progressed by player interaction. What this format loses in flexibility over the first system, it gains in atmosphere and immersion.

Figure 6.7. Myst.

graphics/06fig07.gif

We are not going to include games such as Ion Storm's Deus Ex in the category of adventure games. The action quotient in that game is too high to warrant inclusion, and we would prefer to class games of this type as a union of first/third-person shooters and role-playing games (even though it is a close call to make). Adventure games, on the other hand, are typically thought of as games that require pure thought and logic, and little in the way of reflexes. Thus, the game interface for the graphic adventure does not have speed as one of its main priorities, instead focusing on clarity of use.

### Role-Playing Games 角色扮演游戏

Role-playing games (RPGs), for the most part, have had roughly the same user interface since day one. This isn't necessarily a good thing. In fact, there is a lot about the standard role-playing game interface that we do not like, but aside from incremental improvements, it seems to be a case of using what works well enough, although a notable exception is the starting interface for Morrowind. Your character is defined by your responses to questions posed by interactive characters in the opening part of the game.

The generic role-playing game interface comes in three sections: the character generation screen, the in-game screen, and the inventory screen. These do not seem to have changed much since the inception of the genre, but their forms have been modified and refined somewhat.

Take, for example, an early role-playing game. Out of the Shadows from Mizar Software was released for the Sinclair Spectrum in 1984. Figure 6.8 shows the main game and character generation screen of this game. Pay particular attention to the character attributes on the right of the screen.

Figure 6.8. Out of the Shadows main game and character screen.

graphics/06fig08.gif

Now contrast this with the character generation screen from a more recent game, such as Black Isle Studio's Planescape: Torment, as shown in Figure 6.9.

Figure 6.9. Planescape: Torment character generation screen.

graphics/06fig09.gif

Apart from the huge differences in the quality of the artwork and the capabilities of the target platforms, these screens are scarily similar in function. Sure, there are a few bells and whistles added to the latter example, but fundamentally, the functionality hasn't really changed in the 16 years between the two games. Note that we feel that Planescape: Torment is an excellent game, and we are not trying to imply otherwise by singling it out for our example. We merely want to illustrate how the basic character generation interface has not changed in functionality over the years.

You may be of the school of thought that believes this lack of change is a good thing. After all, it's a system that's been in use since the advent of paper-and-pencil role-playing games in the '70s. However, our view is different. Why use numbers at all in the game interface? They were a necessity in the paper-and-pencil role-playing games, but what a computer is very good at is dealing with numbers. Why bother the player with them? Having "Saving Roll +1" flash up onscreen when we've just dealt a mighty blow to a zombie does nothing except remind us that we're playing a dry game of statistics with some pretty graphics slapped on top. We know that this argument has been used before, and that some players actually prefer to deal with numbers—after all, it does allow the players to know exactly where they stand in the game. However, wondering how high your hit-points are while smiting a zombie jars your suspension of disbelief. Let those players who want to deal with numbers have them, but make them an option in the game. If you need to display numbers (maybe for the sake of accuracy), then at least display them as labels on some sort of bar chart or other graphical representation. To be fair, though, the user interface of Planescape: Torment does allow some limited hiding of the numbers, borrowing the technique of displaying graphical power bars from other genres, which is a neat way of sidestepping the problem.

### Strategy and War Games 策略和战争游戏

Like their cousin, the role-playing game, strategy and war games have their roots in board games. Hence, early efforts were often heavy on the numbers and played almost exactly like a computer-controlled board game. One of the first breakthrough titles that heralded the roots of the more accessible arcade-strategy genre was a title released for the Sinclair Spectrum back in 1984, called Stonkers (see Figure 6.10). This game presented simulated war in a more accessible arcade-influenced format and is arguably the very first RTS (real-time strategy) war game, introducing many of the concepts that are familiar in today's RTS and strategy games.

Figure 6.10. Stonkers.

graphics/06fig10.jpg

More recent RTS games (such as Sudden Strike, shown in Figure 6.11), classic strategy games (such as Civilization III, shown in Figures 6.12 and 6.13), and the more traditional war games (such as Sid Meier's Gettysburg, shown in Figure 6.14) have a similar user experience—at least at a superficial level. All games of this type are concerned with the same basic set of actions: controlling large groups of units to solve a goal that could not be achieved by one unit alone. Of course, once you go beyond this superficial level, there is some variance in the user interface; for example, Civilization III has a diplomatic and city control interface that handles specific decisions at a wider level than those simply concerned with unit- and group-level decisions.

Figure 6.11. Sudden Strike.

graphics/06fig12.gif

Figure 6.13. Civilization III foreign advisory interface.

graphics/06fig13.gif

Figure 6.14. Sid Meier's Gettysburg.

graphics/06fig14.gif

Because of its universal nature, the unit- and group-based interface has evolved to allow the player to control these groups easily. Games such as Blizzard's Warcraft and Westwood's Command and Conquer series have helped define the standard interface for RTS games that most games now follow. Left-clicking to select a unit, and then right-clicking on an object to select a context-sensitive action for the unit to perform on that object, have become familiar actions for most RTS gamers. More recently, the ability to click-drag select a group of units (a method borrowed directly from the Windows operating system) has been added to the repertoire.

However, as these games have become more complex, ways of managing that complexity become needed. This has prompted a divergence in the interfaces, especially with respect to the camera control mechanisms in those games that give the player control of the camera (although why the player would want to control the camera is beyond us—except in special situations, that should be a job for the computer).

Strategy games and war games are characterized by the strategic-level decisions the player is required to make. Consequently, the interface has to allow the player to make these strategic decisions. Note that a lot of these games (for better or worse) also include a fair amount of micromanagement of individual units, usually in the form of giving orders or training. This micromanagement is usually handled by a contextual iconic interface.

In order to be an effective interface, it has to seamlessly handle three levels of abstraction: grand strategy (as in Figure 6.13), group and unit navigation (as in Figure 6.14), and unit micromanagement (as in Figure 6.15). Not all these levels are necessarily present, depending on the strategic slant of the game. As a general rule, RTS games tend to focus on the latter two levels, group and unit navigation and unit micromanagement. More serious war games tend to use all three levels, usually with a focus on the grand strategic and the group and unit navigation levels. Pure strategy games (akin to computer-controlled board games), such as Risk (shown in Figure 6.16), focus on the grand strategic level, with varying levels of usage of the latter two levels. Of course, the best of these games allow the player to choose to what level he wants to involve himself—from the overseeing dictator figure all the way down to the bean-counting micromanager, and anywhere in between. Sid Meier's Civilization series of games are excellent in their use of the computer to handle such menial tasks at the player's request.

graphics/06fig16.gif

The more serious war games, which have traditionally been rather dry in their presentation, have started to use a number of these more "gamer-friendly" techniques. Previously, these games have focused on the accuracy of the war simulation, rather than any presentational niceties, and generally, that suited the players of these games perfectly. However, in order to attract new players, designers have learned lessons from the more accessible RTS-style games, which in turn were derived from the need to make war games more accessible to the average gamer. Nowadays, the hard-core war games are, in many cases, virtually indistinguishable from the RTS games that they initially inspired.
