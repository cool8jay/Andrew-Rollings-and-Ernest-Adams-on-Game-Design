Using well-defined characters in games has been with us since the earliest days of computer gaming and is becoming increasingly sophisticated as time goes on. The days of anonymous blobs of pixels, such as the gunfighters in the early arcade game Gunfight (shown in Figure 5.1), are far behind us. Originally, it was fairly difficult to get any real characterization into a monochrome 32-pixel-high figure, but with the increasing capabilities of game hardware, the question of characterization becomes increasingly important. Note that text games had no such problem with characterization (but the graphical aspects were not at all important); the main practical limits that affected this particular genre were the skills of the author/designer.

自电脑游戏诞生之初，我们就开始在游戏中使用定义明确的角色，而且随着时间的推移，这些角色也变得越来越复杂。像早期街机游戏《枪战》（Gunfight）（如图 5.1 所示）中的枪手那样，使用简单像素块的时代已经一去不复返了。最初，要在一个 32 像素高的单色人物形象中表现出真正的人物性格是相当困难的，但随着游戏硬件功能的不断增强，人物性格的问题变得越来越重要。需要注意的是，文字游戏在角色塑造方面不存在这样的问题（但图形方面并不重要）；影响这种特殊类型游戏的主要实际限制在于作者/设计者的技能。早期街机游戏《枪战》（Gunfight）（如图 5.1 所示）中的枪手等无名像素块的时代已经一去不复返了。最初，要在一个 32 像素高的单色人物形象中表现出真正的人物性格是相当困难的，但随着游戏硬件功能的不断增强，人物性格的问题变得越来越重要。需要注意的是，文字游戏在人物塑造方面并不存在这样的问题（但图形方面并不重要）；影响这种特殊类型游戏的主要实际限制在于作者的技能。

In this chapter, we discuss the method used to design compelling and believable characters for your game. It's important to realize that not all games require characters to be anything more than simple stereotypes (consider, for example, the Mario series of games). However, enough games out there require decent interactive characters to warrant a chapter covering the topic.

在本章中，我们将讨论为游戏设计引人入胜、真实可信的角色的方法。重要的是要认识到，并不是所有的游戏都要求角色不仅仅是简单的刻板印象（例如马里奥系列游戏）。不过，有足够多的游戏需要像样的交互式角色，因此我们有必要用一章的篇幅来介绍这个主题。

We've split this chapter into three fairly independent sections. Which is most appropriate for you depends on the type of game you are designing. The first section is for simpler games, in which the appearance of the hero and the characters is the most important consideration. The second is for those games in which the character and personality of the hero is more important. The third section concerns the supporting characters and their interaction with the hero.

我们将本章分为三个相当独立的部分。哪一部分最适合你，取决于你正在设计的游戏类型。第一部分适用于较为简单的游戏，在这类游戏中，英雄和角色的外观是最重要的考虑因素。第二部分适用于英雄的性格和个性更为重要的游戏。第三部分涉及配角及其与英雄的互动。

You can design a character in two main ways: through art-sourced design or through story-sourced design. With art-based design, the appearance of a character is decided upon first, and then a background story is fleshed out to augment it if necessary. Generally, the simpler sorts of games—those that require superficial and simplistic characters—use this approach.

设计角色主要有两种方法：基于美术设计或基于故事设计。在基于美术的设计中，首先要确定角色的外观，然后再根据需要充实背景故事。一般来说，比较简单的游戏——那些需要表面化和简单化角色的游戏——都采用这种方法。

# Art-Driven Character Design 美术驱动的角色设计

Let's take a look at art-driven design in a little more detail. Historically, art-driven design was the main force behind character design. As we've said, the simpler games didn't rely so much on story, so the design emphasis tended to be visual.

让我们来详细了解一下美术驱动型设计。从历史上看，美术驱动设计是角色设计的主要力量。正如我们所说，简单的游戏并不太依赖于故事，因此设计的重点往往是视觉效果。

## Visual Design 视觉设计

The design of the central character in Pac-Man was purely artistic. The game designer, Toru Iwatani, was allegedly inspired by a pizza with one slice removed. Other famous game characters were also born this way: Lara Croft started life as the artist's dream girl and quickly became the "larger than life" heroine that we all know today. (This is despite the fact that somebody with those "proportions" would be unlikely to be as athletic as that—and would most likely run into a few lower-back problems in later life. But this is the games industry: Realism doesn't matter—self-consistency does.)

《吃豆人》中，中心人物的设计纯粹是艺术性的。据称，游戏设计师岩谷彻的设计灵感来自于一块被削去一块的披萨。其他有名的游戏角色也是这样诞生的：劳拉·克劳馥一开始只是艺术家的梦中情人，但很快就成为了我们今天所熟知的“超凡脱俗”的女主角。(尽管拥有这样“身材比例”的人不可能有那么好的运动能力，而且很可能在日后的生活中患上一些腰背疾病。但这就是游戏产业：真实性并不重要，重要的是自我一致性）。

Characters that are developed from a purely artistic source tend to be far more superficial and one-dimensional than those sourced from a story-based design. In fact, we could say that they are the bimbos (or himbos—no sexism here!) of the games industry. This is not necessarily a bad thing. For many games, we simply do not need well-developed characters. It's far better to leave the character as a blank slate and let the player impose his own personality. This can aid the sense of game immersion greatly and is often the superior method, compared to trying to force a player to accept the role of a fully fleshed-out character. Even those games in which the player has a predefined character tend to be deliberately scant on background details, just so that the player won't have to change personalities to fit into the hero's skin. A small paragraph of backstory might give the player some direction, but trying to force a player into a role that does not appeal to her is futile.

源自纯粹艺术创作的角色往往比那些源自基于故事情节设计的角色更加肤浅和单一。事实上，我们可以说他们是游戏产业中的“花瓶”（或者“肌肉男”，这里没有性别歧视！）。这并不一定是坏事。对于许多游戏来说，我们根本不需要人物形象非常丰满。最好让人物保持空白状态，让玩家将自己的个性投射进去。这可以极大地增强游戏的沉浸感，通常比试图强迫玩家接受一个完全塑造出来的角色要优越得多。即使是那些玩家有预设角色的游戏，也往往故意在背景细节上保持简洁，这样玩家就不必改变自己的个性来适应主人公的身份。一小段背景故事可能会给玩家一些方向，但试图强迫玩家扮演一个她不感兴趣的角色是徒劳的。

At this point, we should mention that the second approach to designing characters is to develop a fully fleshed-out backstory before you even visualize their appearance. This approach tends to produce deeper and more realistic characters that the player will believe in more readily. Sometimes this can be a good thing, and sometimes not. It really depends on the result you are aiming for. For example, a fully detailed backstory for the aforementioned Pac-Man, detailing his likes, dislikes, hopes, and fears, certainly would not have added anything to the game. In fact, it would most likely have detracted from it. It would be as effective as replacing Heathcliff and Kathy from Bronte's Wuthering Heights with Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. We cover story-driven design later in this chapter.

说到这里，我们应该提到设计角色的第二种方法，那就是在设计角色的外形之前，先设计一个完整的背景故事。这种方法往往能塑造出更深刻、更真实的角色，让玩家更容易相信他们。有时这是件好事，有时却不是。这其实取决于你所追求的结果。例如，为前面提到的吃豆人设计一个详尽的背景故事，详细描述他的喜好、厌恶、希望和恐惧，肯定不会给游戏增添任何东西。事实上，它很可能会使游戏大打折扣。这就好比把勃朗特《呼啸山庄》中的希斯克利夫和凯西换成科米蛙和猪小姐一样有效。我们将在本章稍后部分介绍故事驱动型设计。

The ultimate aim of the exercise, whether story-based or art-based, is to create a bond between the player and the hero so that the player is compelled to play the game. You should attempt to make the player genuinely care for the plight of the character under his control. A good, detailed backstory is certainly one way to get the player to empathize with the hero, but this is by no means the only way. In fact, the advantage of computer games is that the bond can be created in a number of ways (such as graphically) and is not restricted solely to abstract concepts and literary constructs.

无论是基于故事还是美术的角色设计，其最终目的都是要在玩家和英雄之间建立一种联系，从而使玩家感到有必要去玩游戏。你应该努力让玩家真正关心他所控制的角色的困境。一个好的、详细的背景故事当然是让玩家对主人公产生共鸣的方法之一，但这绝不是唯一的方法。实际上，电脑游戏的优势在于可以通过多种方式（如图形化）建立这种联系，而不仅仅局限于抽象概念和文学构思。

## Physical Design and Super-Sensuality 身体设计与超级性感

For example, let's consider some physical aspects. Sexual desirability is an often-used method. In Desmond Morris's Manwatching, he discusses the issue of super-senses. In advertising, certain features are often exaggerated to elicit a specific response in the viewer. The classic example is that the breast size and leg length of women are usually exaggerated by about 33 percent, their waists are too small to accommodate the required internal organs, and their hips are disproportionately wide. This apparently increases the sexual desirability of the subject (termed "super-sensory stimulation" by Morris). We've seen this many times in the game industry—I'm sure you can think of a couple of prime examples: Lara and Croft.

例如，让我们考虑一些身体方面的因素。性吸引力是一种常用的方法。在德斯蒙德·莫里斯的《观察人类》一书中，他讨论了超感官的问题。在广告中，某些特征经常被夸大以引起观众的特定反应。经典的例子是，女性胸部的大小和腿部的长度通常会被夸大约 33%，她们的腰围太小，无法容纳所需的内脏器官，而臀部则过于宽大。这显然增加了主题的性吸引力（莫里斯称之为“超感官刺激”）。我们在游戏产业中多次看到这种情况，我相信你能想到几个典型的例子：劳拉·克劳馥。

{% endhint %}

Cuteness works well, too. Some games attempt to bring out the player's protective feelings. In these games, the hero is almost supernaturally cute, and this causes the player to empathize with the hero much in the same way as he would empathize with a favorite pet or a baby.

可爱同样很有效。有些游戏试图激发玩家的保护欲。在这些游戏中，主人公几乎超自然地可爱，这使得玩家对主人公产生共鸣，就像自己喜欢的宠物或婴儿产生共鸣一样。

Compared to fully grown animals, baby animals have large heads and eyes with respect to their body sizes. This can be exploited by a knowledgeable designer to create a "cute-appeal." Usually, this approach is aimed specifically at the younger game players. Targeting the younger gamer with the sexual approach would probably draw unwanted attention from the censors, so, for the most part, this is avoided. Super Monkey Ball (shown in Figure 5.2) uses the cute approach to good effect.

与成年动物相比，幼年动物的头部和眼睛相对于其体型都比较大。知识渊博的设计师可以利用这一点来创造“可爱吸引力”。通常，这种方法专门针对年轻玩家。针对年轻玩家，以性吸引力为目标的策略很可能会引起审查机构的注意，因此，在大多数情况下，这种设计都是被避免的。《超级猴子球》（如图 5.2 所示）采用了可爱的方式，效果很好。

Figure 5.2. Super Monkey Ball. 图 5.2. 超级猴子球

![](/.gitbook/assets/5.2.png)

The monkey characters follow Morris's super-sense guidelines—large heads; large, round eyes; and comparatively small bodies. Coincidentally (and rather perversely, to Western eyes), this is also the approach taken by Japanese ultra-violent Anime comics, an example of which is shown in Figure 5.3.

猴子角色遵循了莫里斯的超级感官准则——大脑袋、大而圆的眼睛和相对较小的身体。巧合的是（在西方人看来相当反常），这也是日本超级暴力动漫所采用的方法，图 5.3 就是其中的一个例子。

We realize that not all Anime is violent. Nevertheless, the artistic style emphasizes childlike super-sensuality while dealing with adult-oriented topics.

我们知道，并非所有的动漫都是暴力的。不过，这种艺术风格在处理成人化主题的同时，强调儿童般的超感性。

我们意识到，并非所有动漫都是暴力的。然而，这种艺术风格在处理成人主题的同时，强调了孩童般的超感官体验。

Art styles vary wildly among different cultures, particularly for characters. Japanese animation often uses huge eyes and tiny mouths for their characters, but the mouths sometimes swell to huge sizes when they shout, which looks grotesque to Americans. European cartoon characters often seem ugly and strange to Americans, too. Two exceptions to this include Asterix and Tintin.

不同文化的艺术风格千差万别，尤其是人物形象。日本动漫中的人物通常眼睛很大，嘴巴很小，但有时喊叫时嘴巴会膨胀得很大，这在美国人看来很怪异。欧洲的卡通人物在美国人看来也常常是丑陋和怪异的。阿斯特里克斯和丁丁是两个例外。

Care must be taken with the super-sensuality approach to character design because it can backfire badly. We're sure a few of you will remember Bubsy the Bobcat. Bubsy fell out of that oft-forgotten (and rightly so) area of design—market-driven "me too" character design. At the time Bubsy was spawned, there had been a run of successful games based around cute characters. The end result was a hideously cynical "cute" character in a stereotypically poor platform game à la Sonic. Note that we believe that Sonic was a brilliant platform game, as platform games go—attractive, quite variable from level to level, and relatively nonviolent. The Bubsy series of games (see Figure 5.4) was a pale imitation of this, and the designers didn't understand exactly what made the Sonic games so good. The character of Bubsy simply wasn't appealing enough to save them. Contrast this with a game series such as Crash Bandicoot, in which the games are good and the character is appealing.

在设计角色时，必须注意采用超级性感的方法，因为这样做可能会适得其反。我们相信你们中的一些人一定还记得山猫巴比。Bubsy 是在设计市场驱动的 "我也是 "角色设计中被遗忘的（这也是理所当然的）。在《山猫巴比》诞生之初，以可爱角色为题材的游戏大获成功。最终的结果是，在一款千篇一律的劣质平台游戏中，出现了一个玩世不恭的 "可爱 "角色，就像《索尼克》一样。请注意，我们认为《索尼克》是一款出色的平台游戏，就平台游戏而言--有吸引力、关卡之间变化很大、相对非暴力。而 Bubsy 系列游戏（见图 5.4）则是对这一点的苍白模仿，设计者并不清楚《索尼克》游戏之所以如此出色的原因。Bubsy 这个角色的吸引力根本不足以拯救这些游戏。这一点与《撞车达人》等游戏系列形成了鲜明对比，后者的游戏很好，角色也很吸引人。

Figure 5.5 shows a small selection of the virtually infinite variety of cute characters out there. 
图 5.5 展示了几乎无穷无尽的可爱角色中的一小部分。

This form of design has a number of secondary contributing characteristics. The primary consideration is the limitations of the target platform. What looks great as a million-polygon rendered 3D model might not look so hot as a 64-pixel-high sprite. Hence, the appearance of an art-driven character is (obviously) influenced by the technology used to display it.

这种设计形式有一些次要特点。首要的考虑因素是目标平台的限制。百万多边形渲染的三维模型可能看起来很棒，但 64 像素高的精灵看起来就不那么火了。因此，美术驱动角色的外观（显然）会受到显示技术的影响。

The design of the art-driven characters is dependent upon the flavor of the game. You have to consider the target audience when you're deciding upon the style of the characters. For example, the adjectives cute and scary will mean two different things to a 5-year-old and a 25-year-old. Resident Evil-style monsters certainly won't go down well in a Mario-esque style of adventure.

美术驱动型角色的设计取决于游戏的风格。在决定角色风格时，必须考虑目标受众。例如，可爱和可怕这两个形容词对于 5 岁的孩子和 25 岁的老人来说意义是不同的。生化危机》式的怪物肯定不会在《马里奥》式的冒险中大受欢迎。

An interesting twist on this unwritten rule was presented in the form of Conker's Bad Fur Day, shown in Figure 5.6. Rare transplanted their cute children's characters into an adult-oriented game. Well, to be more accurate, it was a preteen vulgar, humor-oriented game but that's probably due to the difficulty of taking cute children's characters into an adult world. This form of toilet humor is very British in style and doesn't necessarily translate well to the rest of the world. Fighting the poo monster really appeals to only a certain subset of the intended audience. Note that the reverse would not apply—you couldn't put realistic Resident Evil-style characters in a children's game. It's a one-way transformation.

图 5.6 所示的《康克的坏毛皮日》（Conker's Bad Fur Day）对这一不成文的规定进行了有趣的改动。Rare 公司把他们可爱的儿童角色移植到了一款面向成人的游戏中。更准确地说，这是一款低俗、幽默的青少年游戏，但这可能是由于将可爱的儿童角色带入成人世界的难度所致。这种 "厕所幽默 "是非常英式的风格，并不一定能很好地移植到世界其他地方。与 "便便怪兽 "作斗争，只能吸引一部分受众。请注意，反过来就不适用了--你不可能把《生化危机》式的逼真角色放到儿童游戏中。这是一种单向转化。

Figure 5.6. Conker's Bad Fur Day. 
图 5.6. 康克的坏毛皮日

Another series of games that has attempted the same sort of thing (although without the humor quotient) is Nintendo's Starfox series. Here, the hero, Fox McCloud, and supporting characters are anthropomorphized animals. This is a common approach in literature. Many stories have used this approach, with The Wind in the Willows being a well-known example.

任天堂的《星际火狐》系列游戏也曾尝试过同样的做法（虽然没有幽默感）。在这个系列中，主人公福克斯-麦克劳德和配角都是拟人化的动物。这是文学作品中常见的手法。许多故事都采用了这种方法，《柳林风声》就是一个著名的例子。

## Cute Sidekicks 可爱的帮手

Art-driven character design gives probably the most prominent common element in game design: the cute hero with an optional sidekick.

以艺术为导向的角色设计可能是游戏设计中最突出的共同元素：可爱的英雄和可选的小跟班。

This doesn't always jell as well as it should. For example, Sonic and Tails didn't work well together as a team because Sonic was much faster than Tails and kept running away from him. In other cases, alternative approaches give more success. Even though Banjo and Kazooie are separate entities, they were really only one player avatar; they just worked together inseparably. Link's fairy in the Zelda games served as a sort of tutorial and hint system. Morte in Planescape: Torment told the player a lot of background information in a funny, wise-guy style, but he was a character in his own right as well.

这并不总是那么完美。例如，索尼克和尾巴的团队合作并不顺利，因为索尼克的速度比尾巴快得多，而且总是被尾巴甩开。而在其他情况下，另辟蹊径则能取得更大的成功。尽管 Banjo 和 Kazooie 是两个独立的个体，但他们实际上只是一个玩家的化身；他们只是不可分割地合作在一起。塞尔达》游戏中林克的仙女是一种教程和提示系统。《星球大战》中的莫尔特 折磨》中的莫尔特以一种有趣、睿智的风格告诉玩家很多背景信息，但他本身也是一个角色。

Unfortunately, for cute-style characters at least, art-based design seems to have degenerated into an unoriginal money-chasing exercise. "Can we appeal to the kiddie demographic? Can we get the right mix of cute with 'tude?" Switch on the Cartoon Network for 30 minutes, and you'll see all the evidence you need: Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory, Spongebob Squarepants, and the rest. You name it, it's there. The evidence is there in the games industry as well. Everyone's looking for the next big cute phenomenon. Check out Spyro the Dragon and Jak and Daxter, or any one of the plethora of other examples. It wouldn't be so bad if it were a new concept, but it's been around since the dawn of the industry. Figure 5.7 shows a fairly early example.

不幸的是，至少对于可爱风格的角色来说，基于艺术的设计似乎已经退化成了一种毫无创意的追逐金钱的行为。"我们能吸引儿童群体吗？我们能把可爱和'粗鲁'恰当地结合在一起吗？打开卡通网络 30 分钟，你就会看到所有你需要的证据：《飞天小女警》、《德克斯特实验室》、《海绵宝宝》等等。你说得出，它就在那里。游戏行业也是如此。每个人都在寻找下一个大的可爱现象。看看《恶龙斯派罗》和《杰克与达克斯特》，或者其他大量的例子。如果这是个新概念，还不算太糟，但它从游戏业诞生之初就已经存在了。图 5.7 展示了一个相当早期的例子。

Figure 5.7. Head and Heels from Head over Heels. 图 5.7. 高跟鞋上的头和高跟鞋》中的头和高跟鞋。

These two characters, Head and Heels, are buddies fighting against the evil emperor. The only difference between these two and the majority of today's examples is the originality in the relationship between the two characters: Head and Heels are both symbiotic creatures. Head can jump and glide, and Heels can run fast. When they are linked together, they combine their abilities and can solve problems that would be impossible to achieve individually. The difference between Head and Heels and the rest of the cute brigade is that Head and Heels actually had unique characteristics that made an original difference to the gameplay.

这两个人物，"头 "和 "脚跟"，是对抗邪恶皇帝的伙伴。这两个角色与今天大多数例子的唯一区别在于两个角色之间关系的独创性：头和高跟鞋都是共生生物。头 "可以跳跃和滑行，"脚后跟 "可以快速奔跑。当它们联结在一起时，就能将各自的能力结合起来，解决单独行动无法解决的问题。头和高跟鞋》与其他可爱游戏的不同之处在于，《头和高跟鞋》实际上具有独一无二的特性，使游戏玩法与众不同。

> **NOTE 注意**
> To an extent, this was also true of Banjo and Kazooie. Even though they were implemented as a single avatar (much like Head and Heels when joined), each had individual abilities that complemented the other's.
> 某种程度上，Banjo 和 Kazooie 也是如此。尽管他们是作为一个化身（就像 "头 "和 "脚 "合体时一样）实现的，但每个化身都有各自的能力，与对方的能力相辅相成。

Most of the examples from today are just minor variations on a rather old theme. At least try to inject some originality into it. Don't just go for the "It's like Sonic, except that he's called Phaser and he's a Porcupine!" approach.

今天的大多数例子都只是在一个相当古老的主题上做了些许改动。至少要尝试注入一些新意。不要只是采用 "这很像索尼克，只不过他叫 Phaser，而且是只豪猪！"的做法。

If we might risk boldly stating our opinion at this point, we believe that this strain of "cute with attitude" character design is getting very clichéd. It also seems to be quite cold and calculating from a marketing point of view: The "cute" part attracts children, and the "with attitude" part alienates parents. With the recent troubles the games industry has had with the threat of censorship, a cute character spouting off attitude to other characters (especially those representing authority figures) probably isn't the best way to ingratiate ourselves with parents—and some of these parents are the people with the power to enforce regulation on the games industry. This doesn't mean that we should make our characters sugary-sweet and peachy keen, but we should be very aware of the age and developmental levels of our target audience.

我们认为，这种 "有态度的可爱 "角色设计已经变得非常老套。从市场营销的角度来看，它似乎也相当冷酷和斤斤计较：可爱 "的部分吸引了儿童，而 "有态度 "的部分则疏远了家长。最近，游戏产业面临审查威胁的困扰，一个可爱的角色对其他角色（尤其是那些代表权威人物的角色）大放厥词，这可能不是讨好家长的最佳方式--而其中一些家长正是有权对游戏产业实施监管的人。这并不意味着我们应该把角色塑造得甜美可爱，但我们应该非常清楚目标受众的年龄和发展水平。

> **NOTE**

> Don't forget that kids hate goody-two-shoes characters just as much as parents dislike characters with foul attitudes—but just because a character doesn't cop an attitude with authority figures doesn't make him a goody-two-shoes. The Scooby Doo kids are a pretty good example of nonattitude characters who nevertheless retain their appeal: intelligence, bravery, and resourcefulness. Scooby is funny, too, because despite his large size, he is a coward—hence, he helps make sure scary situations aren't too scary. In addition to this, because he's a dog and not a child, he doesn't get picked on or treated with contempt for being scared. This is actually a very clever solution. Notice also the Archie kids from the famous comic: You have the Everyman (Archie), the Goofball (Jughead), the Girl Next Door (Betty), the Fashion Plate (Veronica, whose beauty is offset by her vanity), and the Handsome Guy (Reggie, somewhat similar to Veronica in attitude). One common theme is that Jughead is pursued by an ugly girl, in a humorous (but actually slightly sexist) role reversal.
> 别忘了，孩子们讨厌 "好孩子 "角色，就像家长们讨厌态度恶劣的角色一样--但一个角色不对权威人士摆架子，并不意味着他就是 "好孩子"。史酷比》中的孩子们就是一个很好的例子，他们是没有态度的角色，但仍然保持着自己的魅力：聪明、勇敢、机智。史酷比也很有趣，因为尽管他身材高大，但他是个胆小鬼--因此，他能帮助确保可怕的情况不会太可怕。除此之外，因为他是一只狗而不是一个孩子，所以他不会因为害怕而被人欺负或轻视。这其实是一个非常聪明的办法。请注意著名漫画《阿奇》中的阿奇孩子们：他们分别是 "常人"（阿奇）、"笨蛋"（朱格海德）、"邻家女孩"（贝蒂）、"时尚板块"（维罗妮卡，她的美丽被虚荣心所抵消）和 "帅哥"（雷吉，他的态度与维罗妮卡有些相似）。一个共同的主题是 Jughead 被一个丑女孩追求，这是一个幽默（但实际上略带性别歧视）的角色转换。
