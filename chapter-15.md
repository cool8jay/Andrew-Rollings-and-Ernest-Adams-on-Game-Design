The term adventure game is a bit misleading because a lot of games about being adventurous aren't adventure games—and a lot of adventure games aren't about adventures, at least, in the fairy-tale sense of going forth to seek one's fortune. The reason for the odd term is historical. It's really short for Adventure-type game, meaning a game similar to the one named Adventure (although it was sometimes also called Colossal Cave, just to confuse things further).

冒险游戏这个词有点误导人，因为很多关于冒险的游戏并不是冒险游戏——而且很多冒险游戏也不是关于冒险的，至少不是童话故事中的去寻找财宝。之所以使用这个奇怪的术语，是有其历史原因的。它其实是 冒险类型游戏的简称，意思是与名为《冒险》的游戏类似的游戏（不过有时也叫《巨洞冒险》，这进一步混淆了事实）。

# What Is an Adventure Game? 什么事冒险游戏？

An adventure game isn't a competition or a simulation. An adventure game doesn't offer a process to be managed or an opponent to be defeated through strategy and tactics. Instead, an adventure game is an interactive story about a character who is controlled by the player. [Chapter 4](chapter-4.md), "Storytelling and Narrative," discussed this idea in theoretical terms. The adventure game is the idea's practical application, although the way in which interactivity and narrative are handled varies considerably from game to game.

冒险游戏不是竞赛或模拟。冒险游戏不提供需要管理的过程，也不提供需要通过战略战术打败的对手。相反，冒险游戏是一个互动故事，讲述的是一个由玩家控制的角色。[第四章](chapter-4.md)“讲故事和叙事”从理论上讨论了这一观点。冒险游戏是这一理念的实际应用，尽管不同游戏处理互动性和叙事性的方式大相径庭。

All adventure games are conceptual descendants of the original Adventure. Although the genre has changed considerably over the years, the games are characterized by certain qualities that they all share: exploration, collection or manipulation of objects, puzzle solving, and a reduced emphasis on combat and action elements. This doesn't mean that there is no conflict in adventure games (although many adventure games have none)—only that combat is not the primary activity.

所有冒险游戏都是原始冒险游戏的概念后裔。尽管多年来这一类型的游戏发生了很大变化，但它们都有一些共同的特点：探索、收集或操作物品、解谜，以及减少对战斗和动作元素的强调。这并不意味着冒险游戏中没有冲突（尽管许多冒险游戏都没有冲突），只是说战斗不是主要活动。

## The Original Adventure

Adventure was a text-only game. Its gameplay was simple but—at the time that it was written—completely novel. The player was an explorer, wandering around in an enormous cave filled with treasures and dangers. A variety of obstacles prevented her from getting into the deeper parts of the cave, but by cleverly using the things that she had found, the player could unlock these areas and continue exploring. The object of the game was to gather all the treasures and bring them out of the cave.

Adventure was the first computer game to give the player a real illusion of freedom, and this remains an important quality of adventure games today. Before Adventure, computer games tended to ask specific questions and expect specific, often numeric answers ("How much money do you want to spend this year?"), or to present players with a fixed list of options and ask them to choose one. The player could type anything she wanted in Adventure, and game would try to respond appropriately. Of course, the game understood only a limited number of words, but because it didn't tell the player what they were, she never knew the full scope of what it would allow her to do.

Adventure also brought personality to computer gaming. Most of the games written at the time spoke to the player in a kind of programmerese. They gave prompts such as "Enter horsepower:" and printed error messages such as "Value too high, re-enter (5-500):". Adventure spoke to players as if it were a person rather than a machine, saying "I don't know how to do that" rather than "Invalid command." It could become sarcastic if the player tried to do something ridiculous or impossible, or even be funny occasionally, another rarity among games of its day. Comedy remains a major element of many adventure games because it discourages the player from taking the game too seriously. Breaches in suspension of disbelief don't bother the player as much in a comic setting as they do in a dramatic one because the player is less immersed in the story in the first place.

## The Growth of Adventure Games

Adventure games were highly popular in the early days of personal computers. Because they contained no graphics, they were inexpensive to develop and allowed great scope for both the designer's and the player's imaginations. A group of researchers at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, inspired by the original Adventure, wrote a much larger adventure game named Zork on the mainframe there. Soon afterward, they converted it to run on personal computers and founded a company, Infocom, devoted to developing text adventures. Infocom published games about all kinds of things: fantasy magic, film noir detective stories, exploration of an ancient Egyptian pyramid, and so on.

The original Adventure didn't have any plot; it just offered a space to explore and puzzles to solve. With minor exceptions, its world did not change as time passed. But it wasn't long before games began to explore the notion of "interactive fiction," an ongoing story in which the player was an active participant. Some games were sold along with books that players were supposed to read ahead of time. Of all the branches of computer game design, interactive fiction has been the subject of the most academic research because it challenges traditional conceptions of what narrative is and does.

As soon as personal computers began to get graphics capability (the very earliest were text-only), developers began to add graphics to adventure games and the games really took off. LucasArts and Sierra On-Line dominated the genre, and for a while they produced the best-looking, highest-class games on the market: funny, scary, mysterious, and fascinating. Adventure games provided challenges and explored areas that other genres didn't touch. Myst, a point-and-click graphic adventure, was for many years the best-selling personal computer game of all time. (It has recently been supplanted by The Sims.)

## Adventure Games Today

In the past few years, the market for adventure games has grown more slowly than the market for other genres. Adventure games depend less on display technology than fast-paced action games do; as a result, they get less attention from the gaming press, which has led to a misconception that the adventure game genre is "dead." In fact, adventure games are alive and well; they're just less highly publicized than their high-adrenaline cousins.

The invention of 3D hardware accelerators has actually given adventure games a new lease on life. We usually think of dynamic three-dimensional worlds in the contexts in which they first appeared—vehicle simulations and first-person shooters—but 3D hardware has a lot to offer adventure games as well. The first graphical adventure games came with gorgeously painted but static backdrops for every scene. Players could see a lot of things but could touch very few of them. But when every object is rendered in three dimensions and it's possible to move freely among them, the world becomes much more immediate and alive.

The static-backdrop adventure game is still very much with us, but nowadays it is likely to use scenes created with 3D rendering software and raytracing rather than pixel painting. Myst was the first commercial game to use 3D rendered backgrounds, which contributed to its success.

### Action-Adventures

The arrival of 3D hardware also gave rise to a new sort of game, a combination of action game and adventure game called, unsurprisingly, an action-adventure. The action-adventure is faster paced than a pure adventure game, and it includes physical as well as conceptual challenges. Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is a good example of the type. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time might be considered another, although, with its levels and bosses, it's closer to being a pure action game. Exactly when a game stops being an adventure game and becomes an action game is a matter of interpretation. By some interpretations, the Tomb Raider games are action-adventures because they do include puzzles, but the puzzles aren't all that clever, and the action is so continuous that we would classify it as an action game.

Adventure game purists don't care for action-adventures; generally, they dislike any sort of physical challenge or time pressure. If you plan to make your game an action-adventure, you should be aware that although your design might appeal to some action gamers who might not otherwise buy your game, you might also discourage some adventure gamers who would.

### The Replayability Question

At first glance, it would seem that the greatest disadvantage of adventure games is their lack of replayability. Because most adventure games consist of puzzles with a single solution, when you know the solution, there's not much challenge in playing it again. An adventure game that requires 40 hours to finish the first time might take only 4 the second time.

In practice, however, this turns out not to be much of a problem. Research has shown that a great many players never finish their games at all; even if the game offers 30 or 40 hours of gameplay, many players play for only 15 or 20. This suggests that if they can't replay a 40-hour game for another 40 hours, it's unlikely to bother them. Provided that the game is good value for the money the first time around, it doesn't need to be replayable.

# The Common Elements of Adventure Games

In most adventure games, the player's avatar is presented with an explorable area containing a variety of puzzles or problems to be solved. Solving these problems opens up new areas for exploration or advances the story line in some way, giving the player new information and new problems to solve. Exploring the environment and manipulating items in it is a key element of most adventure games, although this is not an absolute requirement. It's theoretically possible to develop an adventure game that consists entirely of conversations with nonplayer characters (NPCs), but we haven't yet seen one.

## Setting

In some kinds of games, such as chess and Quake, the setting is almost irrelevant. Serious players ignore the idea that chess is a medieval war game or that Quake is about space marines on an alien planet. They concentrate on the bare essentials of the gameplay: strategy in the former case and blazing action in the latter. If the setting intrudes, it is only a distraction.

In adventure games, this situation is reversed. The setting in an adventure game contributes more to its entertainment value than in any other genre. Whether it's grim and depressing, fantastic and outlandish, or funny and cheerful, the setting creates the world the player is going to explore and to live in, and it is for many players the reason for playing adventure games in the first place.

### Emotional Tone

The majority of computer games have little emotional subtlety. Games of pure strategy have no emotional content at all; action games and war games have little more. Nor do they inspire complex emotions in the player. "Yippee!" and "Damn!" are about the limit of it—exhilaration and frustration, respectively. Role-playing games (RPGs), with their deeper stories, offer greater opportunities for emotional expression, but even when their designers take advantage of it, the emotion tends to get lost in a morass of bookkeeping. The players spend so much time buying and selling equipment and trying to optimize their combat effectiveness that the emotional content of the story is obscured.

Adventure games do not have intricate strategy, high-speed action, or management details to entertain the player. The games move more slowly, which gives players the chance to create a world with a distinct emotional tone.

## Interaction Model

All adventure games are avatar-based because the player is being represented by someone who is inside a story. However, the nature of the avatar in adventure games has changed somewhat over the years. Both Adventure and Myst were careful to avoid ascribing characteristics to the avatar in the game—sex, age, and so on. The avatar wasn't a character with his or her own personal history; it was the player, but because the game didn't know anything about the player, it couldn't depict her or say much about her. A number of later text adventures asked for the player's name and sex when started up, using that information later in the game. They were trying to create the impression that it really was "you" in the game world, and they didn't want to offend players by assuming that they were the wrong sex. In Myst, the world was shown from a first-person perspective, and there were no mirrors in which the player could catch sight of herself.

Eventually, however, game designers began to find this model too limiting. They wanted to develop games in which the avatar was a character with a personality of his own, someone who belonged in the game world rather than being a visitor there. Two good examples of this approach are Sierra On-Line's Leisure Suit Larry series and LucasArts's Monkey Island series. In these games, the player could see his avatar walking around interacting with the world. Both Larry and Guybrush Threepwood, the hero of the Monkey Island games, are comic figures, and the games are played primarily for laughs.

There was initially some concern that male players would be unwilling to play female characters, but Lara Croft has demonstrated emphatically that this is not a problem. Female players quite justifiably get tired of playing male heroes because there are so many of them. We think the decision about whether to make your game's avatar male or female shouldn't be based on marketing considerations, but upon the needs of the story. In many cases, the avatar's sex really isn't important anyway, although it might influence the way other characters in the game react. Try to design an avatar who is interesting and likeable. Because this is someone the player will be seeing all the time, the avatar must be a person the player can identify with and must possess qualities he is likely to admire: bravery, intelligence, decency, and a sense of humor, for example. Chapter 5, "Character Development," discusses these issues in more detail.

## Perspective

The preferred camera perspective of graphic adventure games is changing. The context-sensitive approach is traditional, but third- and first-person games are becoming increasingly common. Here we examine their advantages and disadvantages.

## Context Sensitive

In the context-sensitive perspective, the game depicts the avatar over a (mostly) static background. When the avatar walks through a door or off the edge of the screen, the background changes to depict his new location. In the early days of graphic adventure games, the camera angles tended to be quite dull, as in Figure 15.1, from Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards.

Figure 15.1. A scene in the original Leisure Suit Larry.

graphics/15fig01.gif

As display hardware improved, game development began to require more artists and the quality of the artwork improved considerably. The game's art director chose a camera position designed to show off each location to best effect. Compare Figure 15.1 with Figure 15.2 from Grim Fandango.

Figure 15.2. A scene in Grim Fandango. Note the camera position.

graphics/15fig02.gif

A context-sensitive perspective lets the designer (or art director) play cinematographer, using camera angles, composition, and lighting to enhance the story. Use these techniques with discretion, however. A light touch is best. If you watch movies closely, you'll notice that the majority of shots are pretty straightforward. Movie directors don't use unexpected angles just for the fun of it; they do so to make a deliberate point.

## First Person

One of the most famous graphic adventure games of all, Myst, used a first-person perspective. The player's avatar was not seen; in fact, like the earliest text adventures, the player didn't really have an avatar in the sense of a character who belonged in the story. Instead, it was the player himself who was in the game world. Unlike first-person shooters, however, Myst did not render a three-dimensional game world in real time. The game world consisted of a large number of prerendered still frames, which it showed one at a time as the player walked around. Being prerendered, these stills were finely detailed and highly atmospheric. On the other hand, they couldn't depict continuously moving objects or changes in the sunlight as time passed, and the player couldn't look at things from any angle. The world was rich but static.

A real-time 3D first-person perspective gives the player the best sense of being in the world himself, but it doesn't let the player see his avatar unless the game has a functioning reflective surface in it. It also tends to encourage a more action-oriented approach to playing the game, running around without paying much attention to the surroundings. Finally, 3D hardware is still not advanced enough to render extremely detailed scenes (a room crammed with hundreds of complex objects, for example) in real time.

## Third Person

The third-person perspective keeps the player's avatar constantly in view, as in Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine or in action games such as Mario 64. This perspective is common for action-adventures in which the player might need to react quickly (see Figure 15.3).

Figure 15.3. Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. This is the typical action-adventure perspective.

graphics/15fig03.jpg

If the third-person perspective always remains behind the avatar's back, however, the view gets rather dull and doesn't let the player really appreciate the environment. And unlike pure action games in which the avatar's actions and motivations are simple, adventure games sometimes need camera perspectives that allow for more subtle situations. In Figure 15.4, from Gabriel Knight 3, Gabriel is hiding and watching to see when the maid is going to leave the room.

Figure 15.4. Gabriel Knight 3 in a context-sensitive camera angle.

The later Gabriel Knight games also allowed the player to move the camera around somewhat—as do some of the better action games, such as Spyro the Dragon and Toy Story (see Figure 15.5). This mimics how a real person can turn his head to look in a given direction without moving his whole body.

Case Study: The Secret of Monkey Island

The Secret of Monkey Island is more than 10 years old now, but it's worth studying because it spawned a highly successful franchise with three more games to date. Although it was ostensibly set on a Caribbean island in the 1700s and was about a young man who wanted to be a pirate, it was full of anachronistic touches and was played for laughs. In that respect, it seemed a lot like certain Disney animated films—The Jungle Book, for example—although slightly edgier.

When Ron Gilbert, the designer of The Secret of Monkey Island, started work on the game, he had already created an adventure game engine called SCUMM. SCUMM stood for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (an earlier LucasArts adventure game). SCUMM was an important innovation for graphic adventure games: It put the verbs on the screen so players no longer had to guess what their options were, and it did away with typing. More important for the developers, it enabled them to create new adventure games easily, without programming them from scratch each time. Three of the five Monkey Island games were made with SCUMM, as well as Maniac Mansion itself and several other LucasArts games.

The Secret of Monkey Island included a number of other innovations as well, most notably an insult-driven sword fight. This was a fight between the avatar, Guybrush Threepwood, and a master swordswoman. Rather than making the fight a physical challenge, which would have required a lot of additional programming and would have turned off some players, Gilbert chose to make use of (and make fun of) the way adversaries always insult one another in old swashbuckling movies. When your adversary insults you, you must choose an appropriate comeback quip. If you do, Guybrush advances in the fight; if you choose the wrong one, he is forced to retreat. If you make enough correct quips in a row, Guybrush wins the fight. The insults themselves contain cues as to which reply is correct, so you don't have to find out by trial and error.

It's this kind of humorous lateral thinking that separates great adventure games from merely good ones. The Monkey Island series belongs among the greats.

## Player Roles

In most computer games, the player's role is largely defined by the challenges she will be facing, whether it's as an athlete in a sports game, a pilot in a flight simulator, or a martial arts expert in a fighting game. But adventure games can be filled with all kinds of puzzles and problems that are unrelated to the player's stated role. Indiana Jones is supposedly an archaeologist, but we don't see him digging very much. The role arises not out of the challenges (unless you specifically want it to), but out of the story. In an adventure game, the player could still be a pilot, if that's what the story requires, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee that she'll get to fly a plane. And she might be anything else or nothing in particular—just an ordinary person living in an extraordinary situation.

A good many adventure games do connect the player's role with the game's activities, however. Players' roles often involve travel or investigation: explorer, detective, hunter, conquistador, and so on. The player can even be some kind of a scientist, if it's a branch of science that involves travel: geologist or zoologist, for example.

Be sure that the challenges are not too disjoint from the role, however, or it could be frustrating for the player. Heart of China, which was otherwise a straightforward adventure game, included a poorly implemented 3D tank simulator at one point. To continue the game, the player had to use the tank simulator successfully. This was a real problem; adventure game enthusiasts seldom play vehicle simulations, and many could not get past that point. It spoiled the game for them.

## Structure

Adventure games typically have only one gameplay mode. Unlike sports games, with all of their team-management functions, or war games, with their battle planning, adventure games don't need a lot of specialized screens. Apart from looking at a map or the inventory or examining objects close up, the player always sees and interacts with the world in the same way, and that doesn't change from one end of the game to the other.

What adventure games do have, however, is a story structure: a relationship between different locations in the world and different parts of the story. Over the years, this has evolved. The earliest adventure games, including the original Adventure, mostly emphasized exploration rather than allowing the player to participate in a narrative of some kind. The player perceived little sense of time passing—that is, of making progress through a story toward an ending. The game simply gave her a large space and told her to wander around in it. Structurally, it looked rather like the drawing in Figure 15.6.

Figure 15.6. The structure of early adventure games. Each circle represents a room. S is the starting room, and E is the end.

graphics/15fig06.gif

As adventure games got larger and began to include a story, designers started to break them up into chapters (see Figure 15.7). The player could wander around all he liked in the area devoted to a given chapter, but when he moved on to the next, the story advanced and there was no way back. If the player needed to take a particular object from one chapter to the next, the story would not let him progress until that object was in his inventory.

Figure 15.7. The structure of story-driven adventure games.

graphics/15fig07.gif

With the arrival of 3D graphics and the action-adventure, the stories began to be even more linear. Areas occasionally had simple side branches but few complex spaces or loops. The space in an action-adventure is structured more like that of an action game or a first-person shooter (see Figure 15.8).

## Storytelling

This subject is discussed at length in Chapter 4. In this section, we just reiterate a few of the key points and talk about their significance in adventure games. Adventure games rely on storytelling more than any other genre. We can't tell you in this book how to create a good story, but you can learn from innumerable other resources. A great many theories exist, beginning with Aristotle's Poetics and continuing to postmodernist literature. If you're trying to make a game that's fun to play and, better yet, sells well, it's probably best to avoid some of the more outré literary theories and stick to what works for the vast majority of books, movies, and television. On the other hand, if you're trying to expand the boundaries of the interactive medium with a never-before-seen work of art, more power to you.

Here are a few pointers about storytelling as it applies to adventure games.

### Dramatic Tension

The essence of any story, whether it's interactive or a fixed narrative, is dramatic tension: a situation or problem that is unresolved. This is what holds the reader's attention and keeps her around to see how it comes out. To create dramatic tension, you must begin by presenting the problem. In adventure games, this often happens in a cut scene right at the beginning of the game. The meaning of the scene doesn't always have to be clear; mystery and uncertainty are a common element of dramatic tension. For example, in The Longest Journey, we begin by learning that April Ryan, the avatar and heroine of the game, has been having increasingly vivid nightmares whose meaning she does not understand. At the beginning of the game, she has no goal other than to find out why she's having nightmares. Later, more dramatic tension is added as we learn the source of those nightmares and new problems emerge.

The resolution of dramatic tension occurs at a moment usually near the end of the story called the dramatic climax. Short stories frequently have only one source of dramatic tension and one dramatic climax; longer stories can have several in a row, of progressively increasing importance. A really long story can have several major dramatic climaxes at intervals, and what ties them together is a common theme, setting, or characters. Such stories are called epics or cycles. Richard Wagner's cycle of four operas, The Ring of the Nibelungs, is one such. Each opera is a self-contained story with its own dramatic climax, although some characters carry over from one opera to the next, and all of them concern the fate of the same magic ring.

As an adventure game designer, the puzzles create dramatic tension for you. However, they alone are not enough. They are small, individual problems. There must also be a larger problem that is the reason the player is playing the game in the first place.

### The Heroic Quest

The majority of adventure games are heroic quests of some kind, a mission by a single individual to accomplish some great (or, in the case of Leisure Suit Larry, not-so-great) feat. Although it's possible to write an adventure game that is a detailed character study, no one has done so as a commercial product, and the emphasis on a single person doesn't lend itself to a sweeping epic with a cast of thousands. It's also possible to create a game about a small group of people, but giving the player a group to manage interferes with her identification with one of them as her avatar. Games about groups are easier managed as RPGs because of the natural "party" structure of the quests. An adventure game is more like a novel written in the first person.

Among the characteristics of the heroic quest is that it is always a movement from the familiar to the unfamiliar and from a time of low danger to a time of great danger. For example, if you have a big dramatic climax, it should be the last really major one in the game because anything that follows it is likely to feel irrelevant. This is why the boss enemies appear at the ends of levels in action games. If you defeat the Lord of Terror, it feels anticlimactic and rather unfair to have to fight his second-in-command afterward.

Occasionally exceptions to this structure arise, such as in stories in which the hero is abducted at the beginning, escapes, and is trying to return to his home. However, in these stories, it doesn't get easier and easier until he just strolls in happily. He often returns home to find that things have changed for the worse and must be corrected, or that he must leave again to hunt down his abductor.

Of course, none of this means that there can't ever be periods of quiet; in fact, there should be. In both of J.R.R. Tolkien's most famous books, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, periods of great danger are interspersed with periods of safety and rest for the heroes, during which they can regain their strength. A long story that consists of nothing but action will feel unrealistic and silly after a while.

The works of Joseph Campbell and Christopher Vogler discuss the heroic quest at length, and we encourage you to read them for inspiration (see Appendix B, "Bibliography," for details).

### The Problem of Death

For many years, game designers have debated the question of whether adventure games should allow the avatar to do something that kills him. Some adventure games have proudly noted on their boxes that you can't ever die; others have warnings in the manual that you might encounter dangerous situations. In some respects, this seems like a strange thing to worry about. After all, avatars routinely die in action games and get shot down in flight simulators, so why shouldn't they be able to die in adventure games?

The reason has to do with the nature of the gameplay. In a first-person shooter or a military flight simulator, it's obvious that the avatar is in mortal peril all the time. In fact, in most genres of games, it's win or lose, kill or be killed, and the enemies are clearly marked. Adventure games are different because they seldom have an explicitly declared enemy and the player is encouraged to go everywhere and touch everything. If you tell the player to explore the world and then you fill it with deathtraps, he's in for a frustrating time. Nowadays, most adventure games adopt a "fair warning" approach, making it clear when something is dangerous and (usually) offering a way of neutralizing or circumventing the danger. If you put a dragon in a cave, it's a nice touch to litter the entrance with the bones of earlier adventurers. That ought to get the point across.

Most adventure games have a save-game feature, so death isn't necessarily catastrophic; on the other hand, stopping to save the game does tend to hurt suspension of disbelief. Adventure games shouldn't be so dangerous that the player has to save all the time because it ruins the storytelling. If you are going to include death in your game, we encourage you to autosave the game at intervals so that the player can restore it even if he hasn't explicitly saved it. You don't have to let the player know that you're doing it. Again, it helps to preserve the suspension of disbelief if you don't.

## Challenges

The majority of challenges in an adventure game are conceptual: puzzles that require lateral thinking to solve. There are many types of puzzles; we list a few here to get you started:

Finding keys to locked doors. By doors and keys, we mean any obstruction that prevents progress and any object that removes the obstruction. Many adventure game puzzles are of this type. The challenge as a designer is to give players enough variety that they don't all seem the same.

Figuring out mysterious machines. This is, in effect, a combination lock instead of a lock with a key. The player has to manipulate a variety of knobs to make a variety of indicators show the correct reading. Try to make their presence reasonably plausible—too many adventure games include mysterious machines that are clearly just a puzzle, not a realistic part of their world.

Obtaining inaccessible objects. In this kind of puzzle, there's an object—whether it's a treasure or something needed for some other purpose—that the player can see but not reach. The solution is often to find a clever way of reaching the object, perhaps by building some device that will give access to it.

Manipulating people. Sometimes an obstruction is not a physical object, but a person, and the trick is to find out what will make the person go away or let the player pass. If it's a simple question of giving him something he wants, then it's really just a lock-and-key puzzle. A more creative approach is to create a puzzle in which the person must be either defeated or distracted. The player should have to talk to him to learn what his weakness is.

Navigating mazes. This is an area that's deliberately confusing to move around in so that it's hard to know where you are and to get where you want to go. Use mazes sparingly. They're easy to make badly but difficult to make interesting. A maze should always contain cues that an observant player can notice and use to help her learn her way around.

Decoding cryptic messages. Many players enjoy decoding messages, as long as there are sufficient clues to help out.

Solving memorization puzzles. These puzzles require the player to remember where something is—a variant of concentration. She can usually defeat these by taking notes, but that's reasonable enough; it's how we remember things anyway. The real challenge for you as the designer is to create a realistic reason for the puzzle to be in the game.

Collecting things. This is really a compound version of other puzzles; the player's job is to find all five of the pieces of the magic whatchamacallit.

Doing detective work. The basis for lots of police-procedure games, detective work is great fun. Instead of solving a "puzzle" per se, the player has to figure out a sequence of events from clues and interviews with witnesses. It doesn't necessarily have to be a crime; it could be any unknown event.

Understanding social problems. No, we don't mean inflation or unemployment. The challenges of understanding, and perhaps influencing, the relationships between people is a little-explored aspect of adventure game design. Most of the people in adventure games have very simple, mechanical states of mind. If we devote a little more effort to it, people, rather than objects, could become the primary subject of adventure games, and this would make the games much more interesting.

Only playtesting can tell you whether a puzzle is too hard or too easy, and unlike other genres, you can't adjust an adventure game's difficulty by tweaking some numbers. When designing puzzles, we encourage you to try to allow for lateral thinking of the players. If there's more than one way to solve a puzzle, don't arbitrarily restrict the player to your preferred method. Obviously, you can't build in multiple solutions to every puzzle, but if the player tries something entirely logical and there's no good reason why it doesn't work, she's going to be frustrated.

# User Interface Design

Adventure games, more than most other genres, try to hide the fact that the player is using a computer. By comparison to vehicle simulators, sports games, or RPGs, the user interfaces of adventure games are very simple. The player needs to move through the world, talk to NPCs, and manipulate or collect objects in an intuitive way that does not interfere with his sense of immersion in the story.

## Avatar Movement

The movement interface that you design depends considerably on the perspective you choose. In first-person and third-person perspectives, the player needs a way of steering her avatar around the world, as in an action game. We suggest that you look at Chapter 9, "Action Games," for a discussion of avatar movement in first- and third-person perspectives.

In a context-sensitive perspective, there are two common user interfaces: point-and-click and direct control.

### Point-and-Click Interfaces

In this user interface, the player clicks somewhere on the screen. If the corresponding location in the game is accessible, the avatar walks to it. If the player clicks an active object, the avatar walks to it and picks it up or manipulates it in an appropriate way. Object management is discussed more extensively in the "Manipulating Objects" section later in this chapter. The disadvantage of point-and-click is that the player can easily point to areas that aren't accessible to the avatar (halfway up a wall, for example), and sometimes an area that looks as if it should be perfectly accessible isn't. This can be frustrating for the player. Nevertheless, the point-and-click interface is the de facto standard for adventure games.

### Direct Control Interfaces

In a direct control user interface, the player's commands say "Walk in this direction" rather than "Walk to this point," as they do in a point-and-click interface. In these kinds of games, such as Grim Fandango, from LucasArts, the player "steers" the avatar around the screen. Direct control can be awkward in a context-sensitive perspective because the camera angle changes from scene to scene.

### Movement Speed

No matter what perspective or user interface you choose, we strongly suggest that you implement both a "walk" and a "run" movement mode so the player can move slowly through unfamiliar spaces and quickly through familiar ones. If the game requires the player to move repeatedly through areas he already knows well, it gets very boring to watch the avatar walk deliberately from place to place. On the other hand, if your world is rich and detailed and your game expects the player to examine everything closely for clues, the user interface must make it possible to move around slowly and accurately.

## Manipulating Objects

One of the great challenges in designing an adventure game is in determining how the player should manipulate objects in the world. In many games, the player must figure out what to do with particular objects to solve puzzles and advance the game. In text adventures, this amounted to guessing the correct verb. You often got interchanges that looked like this:

> OPEN DOOR
The door is locked, but it looks pretty flimsy.
> BREAK DOOR
I don't know how to do that.
> SMASH DOOR
I don't know how to do that.
> HIT DOOR
I don't know how to do that.
> KICK DOOR
The door flies open.
Sometimes this was fun; a lot of the time it wasn't. In graphic adventure games, in which the player is using the mouse or a handheld controller, designers can solve this problem in a variety of different ways.

### Identifying Active Objects

Not every object in the game world can be manipulated or picked up; some are just part of the background scenery. The player needs a way of recognizing the active objects in a particular location. Text adventures used to print a list of them. Graphic adventures have typically used one of four mechanisms:

Hunt and click. Active objects don't look any different from anything else; the player simply has to click everything in the scene to see if it's active. This makes the scene look realistic, but it's annoying for the player, especially if some of the objects are small or partially hidden. This mechanism has generally been abandoned in favor of the following ones.

Permanently highlighted objects. The active objects in a scene are permanently highlighted in some way—either they're slightly brighter than the rest of the scene or they're surrounded by a line of light or dark pixels, to make them stand out against the background. The moment the scene appears on the screen, the player can tell which objects are active. It's convenient, if artificial.

Dynamically highlighted objects. The active objects in a scene normally look like part of the background, but they are highlighted when the mouse cursor passes over them. Either the object lights up or the cursor changes shape. It still means that the player has to do some hunting, but it's much easier than hunting and clicking; a quick wave of the cursor tells the player if there's an active object nearby.

Focus-of-attention highlighting. This mechanism is typically used with hand held controllers when the player doesn't have a mouse cursor. As the avatar moves around in a scene, his focus of attention changes depending on the direction he is looking. Whatever active object is directly in front of him is the focus of his attention and is highlighted. When he turns away, its highlighting disappears again. The disadvantage of this mechanism is that if two active objects are close together, it can be tricky to point the avatar in exactly the right direction to put the focus of attention on the desired object.

### One-Button Actions

In a graphic adventure game played with a handheld controller, designers often assign one button of the controller to a generic "use" or "manipulate" function: The player moves the avatar near the object and presses the "use" button for obvious functions such as opening a door or throwing a switch. The player can always count on the button to do the right thing with an object, whatever that might be. Some mouse-based games use a similar mechanism: Clicking an object does something appropriate with it. This makes the game very easy to play because there's no guessing about what you should do. The disadvantage of this system is that there can be only one action per object, so it doesn't allow the designer to challenge the player's lateral thinking.

### Menu-Driven Actions

A number of games use a menu to allow the player to select the action he wants to take and the object that he wants to manipulate (see Figure 15.9). This gives the player a clear picture of his choices, but it does feel a little "computery."

Figure 15.9. The action menu in The Secret of Monkey Island.

In another variant, the player places the mouse cursor over the desired object and right-clicks it. A pop-up menu appears, showing a series of icons that represent the actions "take," "use," "examine," and possibly others (see Figure 15.10). The player left-clicks one of the icons, and the desired action is performed. This mechanism, in effect, shows the player all the available verbs that can be used with that particular object and lets him pick one.

Figure 15.10. The pop-up menu in The Longest Journey (at right, under tent). Note that the icons are an eye, a mouth, and a hand, meaning "look at," "talk to," and "manipulate."

### Managing Inventory

Picking things up and carrying them around until they're needed later has been a major feature of adventure gaming since its beginning. Most games implement a limit on the amount of stuff the player can carry. (However, a few did not, for humorous effect: In Haunt, a noncommercial text adventure, the player could be walking through a haunted house wearing a wetsuit and carrying around a stereo, an antique chair, and an oil painting, along with an unlimited number of other items.) With the arrival of graphics, the inventory is usually handled as a pop-up box that shows everything the player is carrying whenever she asks to see it. If the box has a fixed size on the screen, it creates a natural limit on the amount a player can carry. When the box is full, she can't put anything else in it unless she takes something out first.

Inventory management is something the player will need to do frequently, so you should make it as easy as possible. One possibility is to devote a part of the screen to the inventory all the time. This is very easy to work with, although it tends to remind the player that he's using a computer. Its biggest disadvantage is that, unless you sacrifice a lot of screen area or implement a scrollbar, it can't be very big.

The more common solution is to give the player an inventory menu that she can open and close on demand. She should be able to do this with a single keystroke or button click. It should not obscure the whole screen—that feels like a mode change and tends to destroy suspension of disbelief. Instead, the box, bag, or whatever the inventory looks like should allow the player to drag objects in and out of it, from the game world to the inventory, and vice versa, quickly and efficiently. The Longest Journey included shortcut keys that allowed players to change the object currently being held in the avatar's hand without opening the inventory box, which was very convenient. Managing the inventory this way also means that you won't have to create animations of the avatar picking up and dropping every possible item in the game. Asheron's Call, an online RPG, includes "pick up" and "drop" animations, but they don't actually show the object in the avatar's hand.

One design error to avoid in adventure games is requiring the player to pick up every thing she sees. Early adventure games listed the "live" objects in a room separately from the room's description, and there was a common tendency to give every object in a game a particular function. This meant that players had to pick up everything they could, often carrying it around for hours without having any idea what it was for. With the advent of 3D-modeled objects, everything in the whole world is (theoretically) available for the player to pick up.

The inventory is a typical feature of adventure games, but it is not absolutely required. One game, in particular—the LucasArts adventure Loom—was designed without an inventory. The player performed all actions in the game by "spinning" musical spells on a distaff, which was the only thing he carried (see Figure 15.11). Loom was designed to be especially accessible to people who were not already familiar with adventure games. Although it was short and considered by die-hard adventurers to be too easy, it was one of the most imaginative and beautifully executed adventure games ever created.

### Special Design Considerations

The following special considerations apply especially to adventure games, although there is some crossover with RPGs as well.

## Conversations with NPCs

From the original Adventure onward, adventure games have always faced the problem of how to create realistic NPCs in the game world. RPGs have this problem, too, but in most of them, the NPC's conversation is defined by the role to which he's assigned: blacksmith, healer, tavern keeper, and so on. The player doesn't expect to be able to discuss arms and armor with a tavern keeper (although the games might be more interesting, and certainly less formulaic, if he could). But because adventure games are interactive stories, players expect the characters in them to be more human and less mechanical.

A good many games have tried to sidestep the problem entirely by setting the game in a world where there are extremely few people or none at all. This certainly creates a mysterious atmosphere, but it's suitable only for a limited range of stories. Imagine how Rick's bar in Casablanca would feel if it weren't full of people drinking and gambling. A world with no people in it is artificial and sterile.

A few early text-based games tried to implement parsers that could understand limited English sentences as typed by the player, but these seldom succeeded. You got either an NPC saying "I don't understand that" when you had asked a perfectly reasonable question, or an NPC whose answers weren't quite to the point, giving the impression that he was drugged or mentally ill.

### Scripted Conversations

In the end, most adventure game designers gave up on trying to create the impression that you could talk to anyone about anything and devised the scripted conversation, a mechanism that has become the de facto standard for both adventure games and RPGs. A scripted conversation is a branching-tree structure in which each node represents an opportunity for the player to select one of several fixed lines to say from a menu of choices (see Figure 15.12). Depending on which line the player chooses to say, the NPC responds appropriately, and the conversation moves on to a new node in the tree. The contents of the menu change as the conversation progresses; as the NPC says things the player hasn't heard before, the player gets opportunities to ask for elaboration, end the conversation, or switch the subject to a different topic. Another common choice is "Tell me again about…," which enables the player to return to an earlier point in the conversation and go through it again, if he didn't pay close enough attention the first time.

### Benefits of Scripted Conversations

Although the scripted conversation forces the player to say only the things in the script, it does produce natural-sounding conversations, in which the sequence of remarks and replies is plausible. It also gives you, the designer, a way to illustrate both the avatar's and the NPC's character through something other than their appearances. You can write their lines in such a way that you give them distinct personalities of their own. For example, Guybrush Threepwood, the hero of the Monkey Island games, is a wise guy type who seldom takes anything seriously. The character's vocabulary, grammar, dialect, and—if the game has recorded audio of the conversation—tone of voice and accent are all important cues.

In addition to letting the player discuss a variety of topics with a given NPC, the menu system allows the player to choose a variety of different attitudes in which she says the same thing: aggressive, deferential, formal, or flippant, for example. The NPC can then respond to each of these in whatever way his character dictates. For example, a powerful character who brooks no nonsense might be offended by wisecracks and refuse to talk to the player anymore. (If you do this and the NPC's information is vital to the plot, make sure that either the NPC gets over his snit after a while or there's some other way for the player to obtain the information.)

The scripted conversation is not merely a mechanism for giving the player information, however. It's a real part of the gameplay, and the player's choices can have a distinct effect on the progress of the game. For example, an NPC could ask the player to entrust him with a valuable secret. The player's decision, whether to tell or not to tell, could have far-reaching consequences. The player has to choose based on her assessment of the NPC's character—to which you, the designer, must provide clues.

## Mapping

When playing text adventures, players usually needed to make a map for themselves as they went along. Because the rooms were not physically modeled but were only described, it was difficult for the players to remember how the rooms were related to one another. A lot of text adventure worlds were also purposefully illogical, so a map was really important for keeping track of the relationships between different areas.

With the arrival of graphic adventures, mapping became less critical because the graphics provided cues about where the player was and how his current location related to other areas in the world. However, we think it's a good idea to give the player a map. A few games deliberately deny the player a map to make the game more difficult, but this is usually poor design—an obstacle that slows down the player without providing any entertainment value. There's not a lot of fun in being lost. If you force the player to make his own map, he has to constantly look away from the screen to a sketch pad at his side; that's a tedious business that rapidly destroys suspension of disbelief.

The map that you give the player doesn't have to be complete at the beginning of the game; it can start out empty and be filled in as the player moves around, a process called automapping. The player should be able to refer to his map conveniently at any time. It's also a good idea to give the player a compass to tell him which direction he's facing.

Automapping destroys the challenge imposed by mazes, but we think mazes are one of the most overused and least-enjoyed features of adventure games. Unless you have a good reason for including a maze and can construct one that's really clever and fun to be in, don't do it.

## Journal Keeping

Another common feature of adventure games—one that is conceptually similar to automapping—is automatic journal keeping. The game fills in a journal with text as the player goes along, recording important events or information she has learned. If the plot is convoluted or there are large numbers of characters in the game, the journal is an invaluable reference tool for the player. Let her call it up and look at it at any reasonable time (though not, perhaps, while hanging over the edge of a cliff or being interrogated by a mean bad guy). As with conversations with NPCs, the journal gives you an opportunity to define the avatar's character through her use of language.

## A Few Things to Avoid

As adventure games have evolved, their designers have created many different kinds of puzzles and experiences for the player. Some of these are extremely clever, such as the insult-driven sword fight in The Secret of Monkey Island. A good many others, however, proved to be only tiresome time wasters, obstacles that added no entertainment value to the game.

### Puzzles Solvable Only by Trial and Error

If you give the player a puzzle that has a fixed number of possible solutions of equal probability (in effect, a combination lock), but no hints about which one is right, then the player simply has to try them all. The Infocom text adventure Infidel included a puzzle like this: Four statues of Egyptian goddesses had to be lined up in the correct order, but there were no clues about what it might be. The player simply had to try all 24 possible combinations and keep track of the ones she had already done. There's not much fun in that.

### Conceptual Non Sequiturs

This is a variant of the trial-and-error puzzle, a problem whose solution requires thinking so lateral that it's completely irrational. A conceptual nonsequitur is something along the lines of "Put the lampshade on the bulldozer" or "Sharpen the headphones with the banana." A few games try to get away with this by claiming that it's surrealism, but true surrealism is informed by some kind of underlying point; it's not just random weirdness.

A variant of this is the opposite-reaction puzzle, one whose solution turns out to be the exact opposite of what you'd expect. You could give the player a rubber dagger and then have it turn out to be a deadly weapon after all. In the original Adventure, the player could drive away a menacing snake by releasing a little bird from its cage. Fortunately, at this point in the game, the player didn't have many options, so he usually found the solution soon. But unless you design an entire game on this principle, it's just an annoying gimmick.

### Illogical Spaces

Illogical spaces were a classic challenge in text adventures. If you went north from room A, you got to room B, but if you went south from room B, you didn't go back to room A. Their modern equivalent is teleporters that give you no idea of where you have teleported to. The player simply has to wander around taking notes until she can figure out the relationships among the various locations. Unless you offer some clues, this is another problem that can be solved only by trial and error.

### Puzzles Requiring Outside Knowledge

Many adventure games rely on some occasional oddities, especially for comic effect, but the player must have a realistic chance of figuring them out. If a game requires information from a source other than itself, it's unfair to the player. For example, Haunt had puzzles that could be solved only if the player was familiar with the 1960s-era cartoon series Beany and Cecil ("Help, Cecil, help!") and with the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It didn't really matter because Haunt was distributed for free and was mostly a joke anyway, but in a commercial game, such puzzles would be unreasonable unless you explicitly made it clear that knowledge of trivia was required. If you want to make humorous references to popular TV shows, movies, and so on, do them in narrative or in an NPC's conversation rather than as solutions to puzzles. Beware, though: Cultural references age very quickly and will make the game seem dated after a few years.

You have to be even more careful when developing games for foreign markets because other countries don't always have the same idioms. For example, the action "Wear the lampshade on my head" could cause other characters in the game to assume that the player's avatar is drunk, which might be desirable in the context of the story. However, wearing a lampshade as a sign of drunkenness is an American cultural idiom that might not be understood in Japan, for example. Again, it's okay to make cultural references in your game; just be careful about requiring the user to understand them to win.

### Click-the-Right-Pixel Puzzles

A few adventure games with point-and-click user interfaces require you to click on a tiny and inconspicuous area of the screen to advance the story, for no particular reason except that it's difficult to find. This is lazy design—a cheap way of creating an obstacle for the player without any entertainment value.

### Backward Puzzles

A backward puzzle is one in which you find the solution before you find the puzzle itself. For example, you find a key, but you don't know of any locked doors. However, you carry it around with you all the time, just in case. When you do eventually find a locked door, you immediately have the solution, which means it's not much of a puzzle. It's not always possible to prevent the player from finding a solution before he finds a puzzle because the solution has to be available, but it can be inconspicuous—for example, a poster on a wall full of posters, or an object in a trash can. Be aware, however, that "inconspicuous" is not the same as "obscure" or "nonsensical." If the key to a puzzle involves finding a live monkey, the monkey shouldn't turn out to be locked in a freezer.

### Too Many "FedEx" Puzzles

A FedEx puzzle is one that you solve by picking up an object from one place and bringing it to a different place, as if you were a Federal Express driver. Of course, carrying objects around until you find a place to use them is a common feature of adventure games, but some games consist of little else. This gets dull after a while, especially if the solution to a puzzle consists only of fetching and carrying without any lateral thinking or other activity. Liven up the game with a variety of puzzles and tasks. It's fun to include objects that have a variety of different uses, such as Indy's bullwhip in Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, or objects that are left over from one puzzle but have a part to play in another.

Adventure Game Worksheet

When beginning the design of an adventure game, consider the following questions:

Who is the central character in the game, the player's avatar? What is the avatar's sex? (For the purposes of this worksheet, we'll assume that the player is male and the avatar is female.) What does she look and sound like? What are her personal qualities, strengths, weaknesses, interests, likes, and dislikes? What sort of vocabulary and grammar does she use? What are her ethnic, social, religious, political, and educational backgrounds? What is her personal history? What is her family like?

What is the story of the game? What is the avatar's ultimate goal? What will occur at the dramatic climax? What things must she collect, learn, or achieve for the dramatic climax to take place?

Where does the game take place? What sort of a world is this? Is the player free to move around these areas continuously throughout the story, or do one-way elements prevent him from returning to earlier areas?

What other characters are in the game? What functions do they serve? How do they look and act? How do they respond to the avatar? Can she affect their moods and attitudes?

How is conversation implemented? What consequences can arise from it? Can the player choose a variety of attitudes in which to speak?

What kinds of puzzles are in the game? What obstacles will the player encounter, and what actions will he be able to take to overcome them? Is this a pure adventure game or an action-adventure? If it's an action-adventure, what are the action elements like?

What graphics technology will be used to display the world? 2D backgrounds? Real-time 3D? How will this affect the look and richness of the world?

What perspective will the player have on the game setting? Context sensitive? First person? Third person?

What is the user interface for moving the avatar around the game world? Will it be point-and-click, direct control, or some other mechanism?

How does the player recognize active objects in the world? How does he command the game to manipulate them? What verbs are available for each object?

Is there an inventory, and, if so, how is it displayed and used? How does the player pick things up and put them down again? Can objects be combined or used together? How is this handled?

Does the player need a map? If so, will it be static or maintained automatically?

Should the game keep a journal to help the player remember things?

# Putting It Together 总结

Adventure games are seldom a technological challenge to build unless you're trying to include powerful artificial intelligence techniques—natural language recognition or generation, for example. They rarely demand a lot of CPU power. But what they lack in technological challenges they make up for in creative ones. As the designer of an adventure game, it's your job to bring not just a story, but a world to life—a world in which a story is taking place. Your talents at creating places, characters, plots, dialogue, and puzzles will be tested as in no other genre. Because the adventure game is not bound to flying or shooting or commanding troops in battle—indeed, not to any particular mode of interaction at all—it has the greatest potential for design creativity of any genre.

冒险游戏在开发上很少构成技术挑战，除非你试图融入强大的人工智能技术——例如自然语言识别或生成。它们通常并不需要大量的 CPU 运算能力。但它们在技术挑战上的缺乏，却在创意挑战上得到了弥补。作为冒险游戏的设计者，你的任务不仅是呈现一个故事，而是要让一个世界活起来——一个故事正在发生的世界。你在创造场景、角色、情节、对话和谜题方面的才能，在这一类型游戏中将受到前所未有的考验。因为冒险游戏并不局限于飞行、射击或指挥战斗中的部队——实际上，它不受限于任何特定的交互模式——它拥有所有游戏类型中最大的设计创意潜力。

All computer games are made to realize dreams. Adventure games realize the strangest dreams of all.
